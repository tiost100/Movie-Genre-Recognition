Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to men

For this he was chained to a rock and tortured forever

Dr. Oppenheimer

First: nuclear fission

Dr. Oppenheimer

At the outset, I think you have a statement that you would like to read for the record

Yes, Your Honor

- We are not judges, Doctor - No

naturally

members of the Security Council

The alleged insulting informationin your indictment against me

cannot be understood fairly

except in the context of my life and work

How long did he testify?

Second: fusion

Honestly, I don't remember

The whole hearing took a month

What suffering

I only read the statement

Who wants to justify their whole life? Weren't you ready?

As the president, I was not allowed to attend

Are they really going to ask me?

This happened years ago Four years ago

Five years

America remains divided over the Oppenheimer issue

The committee will want to know which side you are on

Senator Thurmond asked me to say you're not ready for questioning

Funny, I wasn't until I just said that

"Truthfully, Mr Strauss Address me admiral

Admiral Strauss It's just a formality

President Eisenhower has asked you to be in his Cabinet

The Senate has no choice but to confirm you

What if they bring up Oppenheimer?

When they bring up the subject of Oppenheimer, you have to answer truthfully

No member of the Senate can deny that you have done your duty

it will be uncomfortable

Who would want to justify their whole life?

Why did you leave the United States?

I wanted to study new physics sciences

Wasn't the physics education department here?

I thought Berkeley had a leading department for teaching theoretical physics

Okay I joined it after I built it

but I had to go to Europe first

I went to Cambridge University to study under Patrick Blackett

Was I happier than I was in America?

Happiest? Yes

No no I

I was overwhelmed with longing for the homeland

emotionally unstable

disturbed by visions of a hidden universe

you were useless in the lab

God, Oppenheimer

Was you sleeping?

start again

Sir, I want to go to the lecture

Why?

It's a Niels Bohr lecture

Damn, I totally forgot

Good Let's go

No, you won't come, Oppenheimer

You have to finish painting those chips

do you see her

Don't forget to clean your place!

"potassium cyanide"

Quantum physics is not a step forward

It is a new way of understanding reality

Einstein opened the door, and now we're peeping through

We see a world within our world

A world full of energy and contradictions that not everyone can accept

Yes offcourse

are you OK?

Nils, I introduce you to J Robert Oppenheimer

What is the abbreviation for "c"?

nothing it seems

I was at my lecture I asked the only valid question

No one doubts his acumen

But its laboratory performance is slightly unsatisfactory

- I heard you gave the same lecture - At Harvard, yeah

And that you asked the same question

Why ask again?

I did not like your answer

Did you like my answer yesterday?

a lot

You must be ready for the snake's attack when you raise the rock

Now it looks like you're ready

But don't enjoy the lab?

So he left Cambridge with her beakers and potions

Go to a place where they let you think

where?

"Göttingen"

Bourne? Born

Go to Germany, study under Max Born

Learn the methods of theory

I will address him

she is obsessed

How is your math?

Not good enough for someone who wants to be a physicist

Algebra is like a piece of music

What matters is, "Can you read music"?

Can you hear it?"

Can you hear the music, Robert?

Yes, I can

"The Waste Land"

Senator from Wyoming

Admiral Strauss

I would like to touch upon your relationship with Dr J Robert Oppenheimer

Did you meet him in 1947?

right

You were a commissioner at the Atomic Energy Commission?

Yes, but I met Robert when I was on the board of directors

The Institute for Advanced Studyat Princeton because

After the war he was known worldwide as a great physicist and I was

Determined to appoint him as the director of the institute

Dr. Oppenheimer we will be happy for your coming

Mr Strauss

It's pronounced "Strauss

Oh-ppenheimer, Oppenheimer

Whatever you pronounce, they know me as a Jew

I'm the boss of Temple Imano L in Manhattan

Strauss is just a southern pronunciation

Anyway, welcome to the institute I think you'll be happy here

Yes, you will love the daily commute to work

Your residence in that house will suit you and your wife

And do you have two children?

Yes, two children

I am a big fan of your work

Do you have a degree in physics, Mr Strauss?

Sorry, tea is served at four o'clock

No, I don't have a degree in physics or something like that, I'm a self-made man

- I understand this situation - Really?

Yes, my father was self-taught

This will be your office

I heard he spends most of his afternoons there

I always wondered why you didn't count on him on the Manhattan Project

He is the greatest scientist of our time

in his time

Einstein published his theory of relativity more than 40 years ago

But she never really embraced the quantum world she revealed

"Nature does not accept possibilities"

exactly

You never thought of studying physics formally, Mr Strauss?

I received offers, but I chose to sell shoes

Louis Strauss was once a humble shoe salesman

No, just a shoe salesman

- I would like to introduce you to him - No need

I knew him for years

Albert

What is the matter?

what did you tell him?

he is fine

Mr Strauss, there are things in my past that you should be aware of

As head of the Atomic Energy Commission, I have access to your security file

I have read it

Didn't you worry? - No

Why should I worry, after all you've done for your country?

Times are changing, Mr Strauss

the purpose of this institute

is to provide a haven for independent minds

And that applies to you You are the right man for the job

Then I will consider your offer

I'll see you at the Atomic Energy Commission meeting tomorrow

It is one of the most prestigious positions in the country

with great mobility of course

That's why I'm thinking about it

So, did Dr. Oppenheimer's past associations catch your eye?

before you hire him?

Okay

Didn't you raise your concerns?

At the time I was completely absorbed in thinking about what he had said

To Einstein to make him mad at me

But later?

We all know what happened next

Doctor, during your stay in Europe

You seem to have met a large group of physicists from other countries

Yes thats right

Have you met any Russian scientists?

I do not remember

if you will allow me to continue reading my statement

Mr Rob, you will have opportunities to ask your questions

After Göttingen, I moved to Leiden, the Netherlands

Where I met Isidor Rabi for the first time

Excuse me

An American giving a lecture on a new physics? I need to hear this

I'm American too

amazement

Let me know if you need any help with English

Hey, what does he say?

No thank you

It's a long drive to Zurich

If you don't eat anything during the flight, you will hide between the seat cushions from the thinnest

I am Rabbi

Oppenheimer

I attended your lecture on particles I understood part of it

We're Jews from New York, how do you speak Dutch?

I thought I'd better learn it when I joined here for the semester

Did you find Dutch in 6 weeks to receive a lecture on quantum mechanics?

I wanted to challenge myself

Quantum physics wasn't challenging enough

“Schweitzer” “Schweitzer”?

destruction

You learned Dutch in six weeks, but you didn't learn Yiddish?

They don't speak it much in my part of the park

How miserable you are

Are you homesick?

that you know the answer

Have you ever felt that people like us are not welcome here?

Physicists?

- Funny - I didn't notice this in the department

They are all Jews too

all

There is a German you have to look out for

Heisenberg Right

One might be led to supposethat beyond the quantum world

There is still a real world in which causation hides, however

such speculation seems to us

Quite frankly, unproductive

Thank you all

have a wonderful day

- Amazing lecture - Thank you

Dr. Oppenheimer

Oppenheimer, yes I liked your article on molecules

Maybe it inspires you

If something else inspires you, let me know We can publish articles together

I have to go back to America

Why?

Nobody here takes quantum mechanics seriously

This is exactly why

He longs for the valleys of Manhattan

New Mexico Canyons

Are you from New Mexico?

No, he's from New York, but my brother and I have a ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe

This is the America I miss now

Then you better go home, cowboy

This is for him, as for me and the horses We are not on good terms I do not think so

Pleased to meet you

Did you meet Heisenberg again?

not personally, no, but

It can be said that we met by chance

Upon my return to America, I accepted two positions at Caltech and Berkeley

I'll handle this, it's okay

radiation lab

I assume you're Dr Lawrence?

You must be Oppenheimer

Okay

I heard you want to offer courses on quantum theory

I did it It's in the next room

Did they put you there?

I'm the one who asked for it I wanted to stay close to you experimentalists

The theory will get you to a point

We are building a machine to accelerate electronics

amazing

Do you want to help?

in building it? no

No, my work is limited to analyzing theories

When will you start teaching?

I'll start in an hour

Seminar?

Pupil

one pupil? Only this?

I'm teaching something no one else here has ever dreamed of

But once they know your scientific abilities

They will get more attracted

i must have been wrong

Mr Lumanitz? - No

Okay

Okay this place Help yourself

Sit

What do you know about quantum mechanics?

I understand the basics

So you are dealing with it wrong

Is light made of particles or waves?

Quantum mechanics says both How can they be both?

- Can't - Can't

, but be so It's paradoxical And yet it works

now

Thanks

Mr Lumentez, don't worry

Mr Snyder?

Now let's consider the star

a star A big furnace is burningin outer space

Fire rushes outward against its own gravity

in balance

But if this furnace cools and gravity gets the better of it, it contracts

The density increases

right

Gravity increases

The density increases

And? it's even a vicious circle

What is the limit here?

I don't know

Consider where mathematics is taking us

I assure you, it leads us to a limit that no one has ever reached before

What about me?

Yes, you did You are better than me in math

Dr. Oppenheimer's file contained details of his activities at Berkeley

Why did they create a file on Dr. Oppenheimer before the war?

You should ask Mr Hoover

I ask you, Admiral Strauss

I suppose it has something to do with

His left-wing political activities

Saturday, 2:00 pm, "Support Espana State"

You shouldn't let them talk about politics in class, Opie

I wrote this

Lawrence, you embrace the revolution in physics

Can't you see it somewhere else?

Picasso, Stravinsky, Freud, Marx

This is America, Opie

We really witnessed a revolution

Seriously, get this out of the lab

My landlady is having a panel discussion tonight outside the lab

Are you interested?

I experienced the political scene in Berkeley

They're just philosophy grad students and communists talking about integration

So you don't care about integration

I would vote for him, not talk about him

Especially Friday gatherings

let's eat

I will meet my brother there

How can these activities get the FBI's attention?

to the best of my memory

The Federal Bureau of Inspection was checking dashboards outside suspicious Communist gatherings

And his name appeared

- I caught you! - Oh, my God!

sorry Hello, brother Frank

You remember Jackie

Good evening

Let's go

there, there

Robert, I want to introduce you to Chevalier

Dr Haakon Chevalier, Dr Robert Oppenheimer

- Nice to meet you - Nice to meet you This is my little brother, Frank

and this- Hello

Still Jackie Hello, Still Jackie

Chevalier, are you a linguist?

Your reputation precedes you

What did you hear about me? Excuse me

that you're studying a radical new approach to physics

Which I don't understand at all, but I haven't heard that you're a member of the party

- I'm not a member - Not yet

Frank and I are thinking of joining

- The other day I was saying - - I support several reasons

Spanish Civil War?

A democratic republic under attack by fascist thugs, who wouldn't want to advocate?

our government

They think that socialism is a greater threat than fascism

This belief will not last for long Look at what the Nazis do to the Jews

I provide financial support to my colleagues in "Germany" for the purpose of emigration

I have to do something

My work is very abstract

What are you working on?

What happens to the stars when they die

Do the stars die?

Well, then the stars are dying

It cools down and then collapses

In fact, the larger the star, the more violent its demise

Gravity is so concentrated that it swallows everything

everything, even the light

Could this actually happen?

Mathematics says possible

If we publish it, maybe one day an astronomer will apply it in practice

Now everything I am presenting is just a theory, which cannot affect people's lives

If you give financial support to Spain, do it through the Communist Party

He can get money to the front lines

Mary asked me to provide this

I am Jean

Robert

Haakon Chevalier

You were at the union meeting at Serber's house last month?

right, yeah

Thanks

Robert says he's not a communist

So his information is not sufficient about communism

I've read all three volumes of Capitalism

Is it considered that my information is adequate?

It will make you a better reader than most of the party members

Strict conclusions  There are some thoughts that say

Possession is theft

"personal property"

"Personal property"? “Personal property” is not “possession”

Sorry, I read the book in its original German language

Good

It is not about the book

It's about ideas And you seem noncommittal

I am committed to thinking freely about improving our world

Why restrict yourself to one faith?

You're a physicist, do you pick the rules?

Or do you use discipline to direct your energies toward progress?

I tend to be a bit flexible

Do you always stick to the rules?

I like flexibility too

What?

hey, hey, hey

unexpected

What?

for a physicist

Do you only have Freud's books?

in fact, I'm more inclined to

yang?

Do you understand analysis?

During my undergraduate studies at Cambridge, I ran into a little problem

I am all ears

I tried to poison my teacher

Did you hate?

I liked him a lot

that you just need to make love

I spent two years with psychoanalysts I don't think they brought it up very briefly

You want to convince everyone that you are more complicated than you really are

I think we are just simple souls

I'm not like this

What is this?

Sanskrit language

Can you read it?

that I learn it

read this

Well, in this part Vashnu reveals his fortified self

no

Read the words

"And now I'm death"

"The Destroyer of Worlds"

Camping here would be perfect

The sky will be clear before dawn

The air will cool at night Before dawn it will clear

this is

then I will get married

- Congratulations, Frank - Thank you Thank you

Will you marry Jackie?

Yes, I'm marrying Jackie

waitress

You're right, Opie It clears

I'll go check if there are any stars

continue to talk about ordinary people

But you don't buy into Jackie, do you?

we joined the party

I still don't agree Why? now, me

Is it because this is supposed to belong to you?

I didn't join the party, Frank

And I don't think she should have convinced you of that either

Half of the teaching staff are communists

not this half

I'm your brother, Frank, and I want you to be careful

and I want to strangle you

I will not live my life in fear of making mistakes

Your happiness is my happiness

So I am happy because your happiness is my happiness

Looks like I can see one of those dark stars you're studying on

You can not That's the whole point

Her gravity swallows the light

like a space hole

Is Frank okay?

Okay He just has a terrible brother

The place is special here

, when I was a kid

I thought if I could find a way

To combine physics and New Mexico

My life will be perfect

a little far from it

Okay

Let's get some sleep

That plateau we saw today, one of my favorite places in the world

And tomorrow we will ascend it

what is it called?

"Los Alamos"

I wasn't expecting to see you today

Should I make an appointment?

Hey! Come back here

Alvarez?

!Obi! obby

What? What is the matter?

they did it Hahn and Strassmann did it in Germany

They are the two halves of the uranium nucleus

how?

They blew it up with neutrons

It's nuclear fission

They did it, split the corn

this is not possible

I will try neutron diffusion

you see? It can't be done

Very stylish very clear

There is only one problem

where?

Adjoining hall

Alvarez did it

But look, the fission pulses are massive

I've seen 30 of these in the last 10 minutes

The theory will get you to a point

during the operation

The excess fiery neutrons can be used to split other uranium atoms

chain interactions

You are thinking what I am thinking

You, me, and every other physicist around the world, watch the news

I what? What are we thinking?

Bomb, Alvarez

bomb

I told you, Robert, no more flowers

"I don't understand what you want from me I don't want anything from you"

You say this and then you call me

Then don't answer the call

I will always reply

Good

just no more flowers

won't you come with me

You have to admit your loss, Robert

It's not that simple, Hook

Chevalier, good to see you

Barbara, good to see you

And the brilliant Dr. Oppenheimer

I am Eltonton

- I'm honored - You're welcome

Now can you comment on organized labor on campus?

- Make way!" - "F, A, E, C, T!

I work for Shell, we employ chemists and engineers

Why are there no scientists in academia?

!Obi! Obi! obby

!Obi! Obi! obby

!Obi! Obi! obby

!Obi! Obi! obby

Thanks

Teachers affiliated with trade unions Why not teachers?

Don't you have anything else to do?

Lawrence, academics have rights, too

Listen, it's not like that There's a group coming

I will stay here

not this time

Richard Dr Bush

Why did you come to the north?

Richard, tell Ruth I'm going to Pasadena on Tuesday

Your article on the black hole is published!

Where's Heartland? Summon Heartland

September 1, 1939 The world will remember this day

Heartland, our article is published

that you stole the spotlight

Hitler invades Poland Victory or death for me

Bombardment of cities, occupation of Danzig

During the Battle of Britain, I gradually lost empathy

On the policy of neutrality called for by the Communists

Immediately after Hitler invaded Russia, we became allies

Is your sympathy returned to the Communists?

no

I want to point out that my divergent views on Russia

It does not mean that there is a break with those who have different opinions

for a year or two during my previous marriage

My wife, Kitty, was a member of the Communist Party

From this direction Here I keep the good stuff

I thought this was Tolman's house

I live with them while I'm at Caltech

Do you want something?

No, thanks, Ruthie

So you are a biologist

Somehow I became a housewife

Can you explain quantum mechanics to me?

You look bewildered

yeah, it is

well, this cup

this drink

this is the table top

our bodies

everyone

It is mostly empty space

Just collections of tiny energy waves linked together

with what?

the force of attraction is strong enough to convince us

that this material is solid

You prevent my body from passing through your body

That you're married to Dr Harrison

not exactly

there is someone I feel for

Does she have the same feeling?

sometimes But not enough

You know, I'm going to New Mexico

to my farm with my friends

you have to come

I mean with your husband

yeah, i meant it

Because you know it won't make a difference

Why did you marry him?

I was lost and he was so sweet

Lost?

my ex-husband died

I was 28 years old and I wasn't ready to be a widow

Who was your first husband?

no one But my second husband was Joe Dallett

he was from a rich family like me but

He was a union organizer in Youngstan, Ohio I fell in love with him

To what degree?

So much so that I spent four yearson beans and pancakes

I hand out Daily Worker newspapers at the factory gates

At 36, I told Joe I couldn't take it anymore

I left the party and after a year  I wanted to return to it, so

To him, not the Daily Worker

He said, “Honey, I will meet you” When I return to Spain

Went to fight for the loyalists?

Then he joined the Kataeb, and I waited

And

Joe was killed as soon as he raised his head from the ditch

Ideology killed Joe In vain

The Spanish Republic is not "for nothing"

my husband sacrificed our future

To prevent the fascist bullet from settling into a heap of sludge

This is the definition of "in vain"

sounds a little reductive

realistic

Here I am

wherever this place was

I don't want you to find out about this from anyone else

At least she didn't bring me flowers

We both know I'm not the person you want, Jean

yeah, but it's the end

no

Not if it's up to me, no

That you made her pregnant and acted quickly

Whoever is determined to succeed, overcomes obstacles

I meant it

I know what you want

What about her husband?

we've talked

they're going to get divorced

So that we can get married before it appears in public

What a civil act

that you are an idiot

This is your community

Do you think the rules don't apply to the brilliant?

the sparkle makes up for a lot

Don't alienate the only people in the world who understand what you're doing

You may need them one day

"F, A, E, C, T!"

Union of Architects, Engineers, Chemists and Technicians

Radiation Laboratory Standardization

Lumanitz, what do you get paid per month?

That's not the point, Lawrence

What do you have in common with farmers and port workers?

Many factors

Everyone out! now

you stay

What do you do?

It is a trade union

full of communists

permission? I did not join the party

They won't let me put you on the project because of this shit

And they won't even let me tell you about the project

I know what the project is

truly?

We've all heard of Einstein and Szilard's letter to President Roosevelt

They warn him that the Germans might build a bomb

And I know what it means for the Nazis to have a bomb

and I do not know?

It is not your people who fill the camps with them

My people

You think I will tell them about your policy

Next time you come home from a meeting

Check your rearview mirror

And listen to the noise of your landline phone! And stop being so naive

Why are they watching me?

Because you are not important to yourself You are important to everyone

Good

Good

Understood

if you could be more

practically

I'll talk to Lumantes and the others

don't worry Consider it done

Lawrence

So welcome to the war

I completed my first security questionnaireand was notified

My involvement with left-wing groups will not be an obstacle

to work in the Atomic Program

Why did they not consider his communist associations dangerous during the war?

Senator, I can't answer

Security clearance granted years before Robert met

Good What about after the war?

After the war, Dr. Oppenheimer was the world's most respected scientific voice

That's why I asked him to run the institute

This is why I recommended it to the Atomic Energy Commission

Simply

What do they accuse me of?

I think they just want to know what happened between 1947 and 1954

To change your mind about Oppenheimer's security clearance

I did not do that  I was the head of the Atomic Energy Commission

But it wasn't me who brought the charges against Robert

Who did it?

Former member of the Joint Congressional Committee

He was a very anti-communist named Borden

The FBI recommended action against him

Federal Bureau of Investigation? Why did not address the Atomic Energy Commission?

Why does one leave evidence of oneself?

Why does Borden hold a grudge against Oppenheimer?

It was during the McCarthy era

People lost their jobs because of any hint of communism and then

He read the security file of Oppenheimer, his communist brother, and his brother's wife

his fiancée, best friend, and wife

That's even before the Chevalier incident

How did Borden get access to Oppenheimer's security file?

Federal Bureau of Investigation

Because someone gave it to him

Someone wanted to shut up Robert

Who? Who knows?

Robert didn't worry about upsetting Washington's power brokers

His views on the atom were confirmed,

But he did not always have patience with mere mortals

I received a lot of criticism

There was a vote in the Atomic Energy Commission

On the export of isotopes to Norway

And they recruited Robert to make me look like a fool

But, Dr. Oppenheimer, we did hear from Admiral Strauss

Our enemies can take advantage of these isotopes in the production of atomic weapons

Members of Congress, the shovel can be used to make atomic weapons It really happens

A bottle of beer can be used to make atomic weapons It really happens

I would say that analogs are less useful than electronic components

but more useful than a sandwich

Not every genius is wise

How can a man with so many experiences be so blind?

kitty?

kitty?

kitty

I joined the project

I joined

let's celebrate

Shouldn't you check it out?

I've been checking on him all day

come here my dear

cant say

ashamed of me to ask this

Don't be shy at all

Take care of Peter

Of course - No, for a while, Hook

for a period of time

Does Kitty know you're here?

yeah, of course you know

of course you know

We are horrible and selfish people

Forget that I asked

the selfish and horrible people

They don't know that they are selfish and terrible

Sit down, sit down

Robert, you see beyond the world we live in

You must bear the consequences of this

Of course we will help you

Everything changes, Robert

Having children will always change

No, I mean, the world is spinning in a new direction

reshape it

This is your moment

we are forming a group for a feasibility study

It doesn't have to be "we" but "you"

Lawrence should not be involved in this

or Tolman or Raby You will do it

Who are these soldiers?

I thought you knew that

Dr. Oppenheimer

I'm Colonel Groves This is Lieutenant Colonel Nichols

Clean this jacket

If this is how you treat the provider

I hate to see the way you treat a lowly physicist

If I come across one, I'll let you know

Combat fronts all over the world

But I have to stay in Washington

Why?

I built the Pentagon

The chief officer liked him so much that they assigned me to run the engineering district of Manhattan

What is it?

Don't be clever You know very well what it is

You and half the physicists in this country

This is the first problem

I thought the first problem would be securing enough uranium ore

On the day I took over, he was buying 12,000 tons a day

Processing?

The project just launched in Oak Ridge, Tennessee

Now I am looking for a project manager

Is my name among the candidates?

no

Even though you brought quantum physics to America

which piqued my curiosity

And what did you discover?

You are a passionate womanizerand a suspect in communism

I am a New Deal Democrat

I said, "Suspected"

unstable, pretentious, selfish and nervous

No good qualities? "not even "he's a genius" but

Genius is self-evident in your midst So no

The only person who complimented you was Richard Tolman

Tolman thinks you have integrity

But what amazed me is that he is more knowledgeable than people

Yet you have come to me That you are not convinced of anything by virtue of trust

I don't believe in anything by virtue of trust

Why don't you have a Nobel Prize?

Why aren't you a general?

I will be promoted for this

Maybe I will be as lucky as you

They give you a Nobel Prize for making a bomb?

Dynamite was invented by Alfred Nobel

How will you proceed?

that you're talking about conversion theory

to a working weapon system

faster than the Nazis

who are 12 months ahead of us

Eighteen How did you know that?

Our quick search for neutrinos took six months

The scientist they gave power to will surely complete this quest in the blink of an eye

And who gave him power in your opinion?

Werner Heisenberg

He is the most intuitive physicist with an understanding of the structure of the atom that I have ever seen

Do you know his work?

I know him as well as Walter Bote, von Weizsäcker and Deebner

If we compete with the Germans in an equal race, they beat us

But we have one hope

what is it?

Anti-Semitism

What?

Hitler called quantum physics a "Jewish science"

He said it to Einstein's face

Our only hope is that hate has blinded Hitler

So much so that he refused Heisenberg's appropriate resources, because it would require enormous resources

Our nation's best scientists work together

They are spread out now

This gives us the option to partition

All scholars must see the whole mission to contribute efficiently

Poor security questionnaire It could cost us the race

And the incompetence of some of course

The Germans know more than us

The Russians don't know

Remind me, who is our opponent in the war?

No one should be found outwith your past diminishing

The importance of security from our communist allies

This seems reasonable but not

“You can't tell me no

My job is to say "No" when you're wrong

Have you accepted the job yet?

I will think about it

I'm beginning to understand where you earned your reputation

My favorite answer: "Oppenheimer won't be able to sell hamburgers"

I can't

But I can run the Manhattan Project

There is a way to balance these things

I leave the radiation lab at Berkeley with Lawrence

And the Chicago Metallurgical Laboratory, under Szilard's direction

, and large-scale refining “Where did you say exactly?” Tennessee

The Hanford site The Hanford site

America's industrial strength and scientific innovation are linked by a railroad

Focus on one goal

A single point in space and time, which is exactly here

A secret laboratoryin the middle of a secluded place

secure and self sufficient

Equipped with equipment and houses Keep everyone there until the project is completed

It should have a school, shops, and a church

Why?

If scientists do not accompany their families, we will not achieve a better result

If you want to secure this, you have to build a town quickly

where?

Welcome to Los Alamos

Now there is a school for boyswe have to put it away

And the indigenous people practice burial rites in high places

Otherwise, no one should be present for 60 km each way

enough to find the perfect place

for?

Mission success

They built a town for him quickly

Let's recruit some scientists

Why do I leave my family?

I told you, you can bring your family

I'm not a soldier, Opie

soldier? He's a general I don't need another soldier

What can I tell them

Heisenberg, Deebner, Boethe, and Bohr, what do they have in common?

The greatest scientists of the atomic theory

Yes, and after?

whatever you want

till you feel my shoes on your testicles

You know isotopes and you know explosives better than anyone in the world

But can't you tell us what you're doing?

- I don't know - They're with the Nazis

- Niels Bohr in Copenhagen - It's under Nazi occupation

Did they stop printing newspapers at Princeton?

Why go to a secluded place for a period of time that no one knows about?

for a year or two or three years

General, will you give us a moment?

It's about unleashing hard power before the Nazis do

Oh, my God

"Niels wouldn't work for the Nazis No, never"

But he is with them, not with us That's why I need you

Why do you think I would do this?

Why?

Perhaps because it is the most important thing that will ever happen in the history of the world

What do you think of this?

the curse

They won't let me join this project

Failure to pass the security questionnaire harms one's professional life even after the war

You are the companion of the road Albeit?

This is a national emergency

I have my secrets and they put me in charge

they need us

until they finish our need

Is there any chance of getting Bohr out of Denmark?

No, no chance I discussed it with the British

until we bring the allies back to the continent

There is no way to get him out

Is it that important?

How many people do you know who proved Einstein wrong?

You know, getting on a plane would be much faster

No, flying on planes is very risky

The country needs our services

Harvard scientists say that the building will not withstand the "atomic minute accelerator"

Take them to the architects

When is this place supposed to open?

within two months

Robert, you're so good at improvisation, but this

Your mind can't solve it

Four sections

Department of experiments, theories, mining and ammunition

Who runs the theory department?

I

This is what I feared

You are wasting your effort

So you took charge of the theory department

I'm not coming here, Robert

Why not?

The bomb does not distinguish between good and evil when you drop it

I do not wish the pinnacle of three centuries of physics

to be a weapon of mass destruction

easy

I don't know if we can be trusted with a weapon like that

But I'm sure the Nazis can't be trusted

We have no other choice

permission

The second thing you should do is nominate Hans Bethe to head the theory department

Hey, what's the first thing?

Take off this funny costume

you are a scientist

Groves insists we join

Tell Groves to poop in his hat

They need us for what we are So act as you are

only the better side

This is the only key

And Teller has already arrived

Should I let him in?

No, let's wait for the others

Let's Begin

Hello, Edward

Okay

Gentlemen, we will continue to work here until you complete the theory department at Los Alamos

Edward, can I please

This is very important

When I calculated the chain reaction, I found a rather unsettling possibility

no

But this cannot be true

Show me how you did your calculations

Okay

- It's exponential - No, no, no

that's a fantasy

Teller's accounts cannot be correct

I do it again on the way to Princeton

For what purpose? To discuss it with Einstein

But there is no understanding of the points of view between the two of you

That's why I want his opinion

Albert

Dr. Oppenheimer

Do you know Dr Goodell?

We walk here most days

Trees are the most inspiring structures

Albert, can I talk to you?

Of course Excuse me, Kurt

There are days when Kurt refuses to eat

Even at Princeton

Convinced that the Nazis could poison his food

Who are these accounts for?

Taylor

And what do you conclude from this?

Neutrons collide with the nucleus, releasing neutrons to collide with other nuclei

Criticality, point of no return Tremendous explosive power

But this time, the chain reaction does not stop

Hence the ignition of the atmosphere

When we detonate an atomic bomb

we might set off a chain reaction

that destroy the world

Here we go back to doubts

get lost in your quantum world of possibilities

and you need certainty

Can you do the calculations yourself?

The only thing we have in common is a disdain for mathematics

Who's working on this at Berkeley?

Hans Bethe

Well, he will get to the truth

And if the truth is catastrophic?

So stop

And he shared his findings with the Nazis

lest either side destroy the world

Robert

This belongs to you, not to me

Teller is wrong he's wrong

When you know Teller's crucial assumptions, the real pictures come out

Bottom line!

The chances of a runaway nuclear reaction occurring are near zero

"Near" zero?

Oppie, this is great news

Can you recalculate? No, you will get the same answer

Until they detonate one of these

The best guarantee you will get is this result

Near zero

Theory will take you only so far

Hello!

Hi

We missed him

Do you want to adopt? she's kidding

We wanted to see you before you left

to an unknown destination

Do you know who I ran into that day?

Ellenton

The chemist from "Shell"? union man?

Yeah He's an F, A, E, C, T guy

He complained about our position in the war

From any direction?

No cooperation with our allies

It appears that our government does not share research with the Russians

“Most scholars think,” he said, “that politics is foolish”

Really? Yes

He said if anyone hadsomething he wanted to share

Through official channels, he can provide assistance

that would be treason

Yes of course

I thought you should know

The brat fell asleep

Where's the "martini"?

will be ready now

The conversation ended there

Nothing in our long friendshipleads me to believe

That Chevalier was really looking for information

I am sure he has no idea of ​​the nature of my mission

I soon realized that I should have reported this incident immediately

Oppenheimer's stance highlights the tension between scientists

And the security apparatus

In order to know how the candidate dealt with such issues during his time in the Energy Authority

We will bring a scientist before the committee

Who will they summon?

They didn't mention

Mr. Chairman, if I may, I'm nominated for Commerce Secretary

Why seek the opinion of scientists?

This is a cabinet post, Admiral

We seek a wide range of opinions

I would like to know the name of the scientist who is testifying

To ask him questions

This is not a court

Formality, huh?

No presidential cabinet nominee has failed to be confirmed since 1925

This is just how the game is played

It's in the bag, Louis

So play nice

They bring in the scientists, so what?

You don't know scientists like I do, Councellor

They resent anyone who questions their judgment

especially if you're not one of them

I was Chairman of the A.E.C.

It's easy to blame me for what happened to Robert

The Senate does not believe that the scientific community does not support you, sir

Or should we change our minds?

To what? And we support it

"I faced Oppenheimer and America won"

I don't think it's necessary

Can't we call someone who knows what really happened?

Taylor

will dazzle

Can you tell the name of the scientist they summoned?

"Possibly" - I know if he's in Chicago

or "Los Alamos" during the war

Why is this important?

If he was based in Chicago, he worked under Szilard and Fermi

Not on Opie's staff at Los Alamos

Robert built that place He was a founder, mayor, and sheriff

everything in one entity

"Los Alamos Project" "Main Gate"

All a place needs is a bar

there is no kitchen

truly? We will find a solution

Barbed wire, weapons

Good

We're at war, Hans

The "Halifax" explosion 1917

A cargo ship carrying munitions exploded in Pearl Harbor

The result is a vast and sudden chemical reaction

The largest human-made explosion in history

Now let's calculate the destructive powerthat the explosion will cause

if it was nuclear and not chemical

With the explosive force factor in tons of TNT

but it will be in the thousands

well, a kiloton

When using uranium 235 the bomb will need

Oops, the tool will need a 15kg ball of this size

Or using plutonium A ball weighing 45 kg

This is the amount of refined uranium over the past month

And the "Hanford" laboratory produced this amount of plutonium

Now if we can increase these quantities, we need a way to detonate them

Are you bored, Edward?

Yes kind of

Can I ask why?

We entered this room knowing that the fragmentation bomb is possible

What if we leave from here with something new?

like what?

Instead of using uranium and plutonium, we use hydrogen

Heavy hydrogen Hydrogen

deuterium Do you understand me?

we press the atoms together

Under tremendous pressure to induce it to split

Then we won't get kilotons

thousands of tons

a major fission reaction

well, wait, wait

So how do you generate enough force to fuse hydrogen atoms?

by a small fission bomb

here we are

Since we're going to need it anyway, can we get back to business?

it was not a radioisotope issue

The most important political disagreement is between you and Dr. Oppenheimer

It was the hydrogen bomb, right?

As colleagues, we agreed to disagree on many things

And one of the disagreements was the need for the H bomb program, yeah

Thank you for holding this meeting on such short notice

I can't believe it

here we are

Tell me, what's up?

One of our B-29s detected radioactivity in the North Pacific

Do we have filter paper?

There is no room for doubt about this

The White House says there are doubts

Just a guess, I'm afraid

Is this long range detection filter paper?

It's an atomic test

The Russians have a bomb

We are supposed to be years ahead of thembut some

What were you doing at Los Alamos? Isn't there a tight guard?

Of course it's heavily guarded You weren't there

excuse me, doctor

but I was there

We can now consider the actual mechanisms of detonation

Any ideas?

It's called "The Launch"

We shoot a bundle of fissile material  into a larger ball

with enough energy to reach the critical stage

what do you think?

I was thinking about the implosion

explosives around the ball will explode inwards

crushing stuff

I want to check this idea

I'll talk to the ordnance department, so you can set off explosions

How far have we come?

Nice to see you too

I introduce you to the British battalion

Dr. Oppenheimer, I'm Klaus Fuchs

How long have you been British?

Since Hitler declared me non-German

Come with me, welcome to Los Alamos

Work is underway on schools

and the tavern Always open

I thought of downsizing the support team

Is that? - Mrs Serber, yes

I offered jobs to wives Supervisors, librarians, and accountants

We reduced the number of employees and united families

Are these women eligible? - Do not be silly -

They are among the brightest minds in our society

And sound security

I've reported to General Groves that you've had open discussions between departments every night

Close it "Partition" is criticalto maintain security

VIP only

who are supposed to communicate with subordinates

These guys are not stupid They know how to be careful

I don't like it

You don't like anything enough to rate it

once a week only adult men

I want to bring my brother here - No

Nichols

I have not yet been told if my security clearance has been approved

He hasn't been endorsed yet We're flying to Washington tomorrow

No, you should wait

You realize the Nazis are two years ahead of us

Dr. Oppenheimer, the difficulty in authenticating your security clearance is not my fault

It's your fault

It may not be your fault, it may be your problem I will go

How many participants in these open discussions?

Many, "Partition" was supposed to be the protocol

We are in a race against the Nazis

And now the race is against the Soviets

Not if we start it - Robert

They just fired a gun

What is the nature of the device they launched?

Data indicates that it may be a platinum explosive device

Like the one I built at Los Alamos

The Russians have a bomb, and Truman wants to know what's next

what is next? Arms talks

Arms talks Apparently

What about a "superweapon"? Does Truman know about it?

Did we show him?

not specifically

We still don't know if a hydrogen bomb is technically feasible

My understanding is that this was Teller's suggestion?

Yes - in Los Alamos? -

Teller's designs have always been unscientific

If you want to launch it, you'll need an ox cart, not a plane

Opie - I'm sorry, Dr Loras, that you want to

comment?

no

Because if you put us ahead

The President of the United States should know about it

If the Russians can find out about her through a mole in Los Alamos

We must hurry up

No evidence of a mole in Los Alamos

Robert

Did they put it under the field?

The stadium is out of service

Luckily

Opie - Dr Fermi

I heard you built a small town

Yes, come check it out

Who would ever think of a place like this?

Everyone will go crazy

Thank you for trusting me, Szilard

Do we really need these notes?

When will you test it?

We tested it

The first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction

Didn't Groves tell you?

both

one by one, please

Dr. Oppenheimer?

I tried the personnel department They asked me if I could write

can you?

At Harvard, they don't study that in the chemistry course

Condon, put Mrs Horning on the plutonium team

What were you doing in Chicago?

Did you go to a metallurgy lab?

Why? Why? - you can't talk to -

because we have the right

Only your rights that I gave you No more, no less

We are adults trying to manage the project This is ridiculous

tell him

"Partition" is our agreed protocol

I've had enough of this bastion of lunatics Nobody works under these conditions

You know what, Commander-in-Chief? I quit

thanks for nothing

better without it

Doesn't his keeping him abroad worry you?

We will kill him if he speaks

I was just kidding

No, he hates me, not America

You know, General, not everyone can be manipulated like me

I don't think I understood you

You didn't recruit me, despite my leftist background

You recruited me because of it

to be able to control me

I'm not that precise

I am just a humble soldier

You are neither humble nor just a soldier I studied engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology

You got me

Now that we understand each other, bring me my security clearance

To complete this "wonder" for you

General Groves, were you aware of Dr. Oppenheimer's left-wing activities?

When did you recruit him?

I knew there were doubts about him

I knew he had a very, very liberal background

Do you think he would intentionally commit an act of dishonesty?

I'd be surprised if he did

So you have so much confidence in his integrity?

In Los Alamos, yeah, when I got to know him later

General, are your security officersat the project

They advised you not to give Dr. Oppenheimer security clearance?

They would not have done so without my insistence

So it could be said that you were fully aware of Dr. Oppenheimer's security file

Okay

I just want to ask you one last question

Under current IAEA guidelines, would you authorize Dr. Oppenheimer a security guard for our time?

Do you have the instructions?

under current IAEA guidelines

Would you give Dr. Oppenheimer a wish for our time?

Physics and New Mexico, right?

God, what an adventure

This is why you need an intermediary

I chose Lumantiz

you will be fine

From here, gentlemen

Dr Lawrence

Leslie

I'd like to remind you of what we talked about at Berkeley

Partition, I completely understand

Good

Thanks

Greetings from Berkeley

I came to update you on our progress and to ask for your feedback

So, I'm going to have to share the things that General Groves has kept me from

"I'm sorry, General," I said "I see I didn't say OK"

Good

Gentlemen, let's get to work

there are rumors of espionage activity - Unfounded

At Los Alamos - Unfounded

I was told that there were communists in the project

We didn't intentionally recruit any communistsI just want to know

Whether any of them were involved in the "superbomb" discussions

I remember you asked your brother to come to Los Alamos

At that time my brother left the party

What about Lumanitz?

I had no contributions to Los Alamos, he was just an intermediary

Security was tight, as ex-Colonel Nichols knows

Our security was as tight as it could befor the personalities involved

But there were attempts

What do you mean?

We read his profile here

Should we talk about Jean Tatlock?

Or the Chevalier incident?

Excuse me

It's Lumannitz, on the first line

Hello, Rossi

What? Well, calm down

There was another mistake Lumanitz had just been fired

We are at war, Doctor

Don't be a fool, Nichols We need the boy

Did you handle it?

wasn't wrong

Your friend Lumanitz wanted to start a radiation lab syndicate

But he promised to stop doing that

It didn't seem to stop

Berkeley's security fears of communism penetrating this syndicate

“-F, A”- “F, A, E, C, T”

I'll be there next weekI'll go see him

Your security clearance has been received

It is important that you do not have or renew questionable links

Doctor, do you think social relations

Between a recruiter in a secret project and the communists was dangerous?

I will be more alert to risks these days

But it can be said that during the war years

I felt that such relationships could be dangerous

Potentially dangerous, yes

because honestly

Notorious communists

Listen

My head was filled with many secrets for a long time

Whoever I mix with

I do not share these secrets

you said in your statement

That I had to meet Jean Tatlock in 1943

that you left

Without warning

What effect do you think this will have on me?

I wrote a letter

Blank pages

Where did you go?

I can't tell you - Why not? -

because you are a communist

Why did you have to see her?

Because she made a great desire to see me before we left

At that moment, I felt that she needed to see me

She was undergoing psychiatric treatment She was very unhappy

Did you know why she needed to see you?

because she was in love with me

You spent the night together, right?

Okay

that you enter and leave my life

And you don't have to tell me why

This is tyranny

doesn't comfort me

I'd rather be here when you need me

But you have other priorities now

I have a wife and a child

This is not what we are talking about

Jean

You asked me to come

and that made me happy

but I will stop seeing you yet

But what if I need you?

You said you would always answer

Not even a word?

Do you think it was a good security measure?

in fact yeah

Not even a word

When did you see her next?

I've never seen her

I can catch the last train to Princeton

I didn't say anything I didn't tell you before, Kitty

Today you mentioned it to history, right?

This is a closed hearing

If they don't release the minutes, I'm sure you will

I swear

We had an oath, too, when you were seeing Jean

you know, you

you sit there day after day

you allow them to destroy our lives

Why didn't you fight back?

I'm not calling her, Robert

Dr. Oppenheimer, nice to meet you Have a seat

no need Just wanted to checkif I should

Talking to Lumanitz for being the boss

It's up to you, Professor But I'll be careful

Concept

and about the union

I should warn you of a man named Eltenton

warning?

Yeah, it might be worth watching That's all

I'd like to know more details - Well, I-

I have an interview now, and I'm leaving early tomorrow

Come back whenever you want

since your time is short now

I came back the next morning

Yes, I should have

But there was another man

He said his name was Bash

bash! You met Colonel Bash?

Colonel Bash, would you read your memo dated June 29th, 1943?

Target Observation Results Indicate

Possible links with the Communist Party

Target spent a great deal of time with the communist Jean Tatlock

"attachment recorded"

Was the target Dr. Oppenheimer?

yeah - who did you meet? -

I didn't meet him then, but shortly after

He's the head of project security, shouldn't I meet him?

No, he must meet you

I wouldn't put you in a room with Bash

Why not?

When Bash heard about Lumanitz

He told the FBI that they were going to kidnap him and put him on a boat

And he interrogates him in the Russian way

General Groves has assigned me a certain responsibility

like having a baby I can't see

like a remote control

so getting to know you is

I won't take much of your time

No Not at all Take your time

Mr Johnson told me about a conversation I had yesterday that piqued my interest

I spent the day worrying

Yeah, I don't want to talk to Lumanitz without permission

I don't care about this part

but a little more than that

in my opinion, more serious

Now that the FBI has indicatedthat such information

will not be admissible in court

Bash made it clear that his intent was not to let anyone testify

Now the FBI shut him up, but this is the guy you're dealing with

I imagine you know other people who are interested in the work of the radiation laboratory

a man associated with the Soviet consul

referred through intermediaries

to project personnel that he was in a position to pass on the information

Why would anyone on the project want to do that?

Frankly, I understand that there might be an argument for the Commander-in-Chief

Tell the Russians that they are our alliesafter all

But I don't like the idea of ​​using informal channels

may not hurt to be on the loose with this

And you said that to Bash?

I was trying to explain to him that Russia is not Germany

Boris Bash is the son of a Russian Orthodox bishop

Born here, but returned to Russia in 1918 to fight the Bolsheviks

This man killed communists with his bare hands

I don't decide who should or shouldn't have the information

My job is to prevent them from passing illegally

Can you be more precise?

There's a man whose name I've been told several times

I think he's a chemist who works at Shell

talk to one of his friends

Who is an acquaintance of an employee in the project

Do you think this will please Bash?

I was trying to give them Eltenton without creating a bigger problem

I told them a complicated story

You lied to General Grover too?

No I confessed to him that I lied to Bash

Do you remember this conversation about the Chevalier accident?

I've seen a lot of this

I wasn't confused before but I definitely am now

And what did you conclude?

He was influenced by the typical thinking of American students

Slander causes harm

amazing

Can we find out who mediated the communication?

It's going to get people involved that we shouldn't be involved in

Is this person a member of the project?

He's a faculty member, yeah, but he's not on the project

So Eltinton's approach was through a member of the Berkeley faculty?

As far as I know As far as I know, yes

But there may have been more than one person involved

Gentlemen, if I don't seem to be cooperative, I think you understand

This is because of my determination not to harm innocent people

You want to protect your friend, but who will protect you?

You can protect me

if you give me the name

If you command me, I will give it to you

You're wrong, Robert You should give me the name willingly

Did he give you the name? Yes

But not at the time, right? - No

Actually that was a few months later, right?

Okay

you find me persistent

Yes, you are very persistent, but this is your job

My job is to protect those who work for me

instead of resorting to certain means

that might catch your attention

and disturbing you

I would like to discuss these with you first

I don't like making plans, I just need to get the whole thing figured out

In the months between your interview with Dr. Oppenheimer

And his final assignment to Chevalier

Did you spend resources to discover the name of the broker?

Big resources, yeah

Without the name Our work was very difficult

And when did you get the name?

I was away when Oppenheimer delivered the name

Away?

They thought I would be more useful in Europe

To follow up on the Nazi bomb project

Who moved you?

General Groves

He brought me to London

It's early for the Christmas party

something is fishy travel tolman

where?

Ruth didn't tell me

Come on, Ruthie, if you don't tell me, who are you going to tell?

Partition, Opie

Why do you think I know where he is?

Because you always know where Mr Tolman is when needed

Like now?

!attention

An early birthday gift for everyone

The British pilots put me in the bomb bay

They showed me the oxygen, but I was confused

When they took me out in Scotland, I was unconscious

but I pretended I was napping

Enjoy the party

Is it big enough?

to end the war?

to end all wars

Heisenberg ran into me in Copenhagen

It was disturbing to see my former student working with the Nazis

Tell me some things that attract me

Continuous fission reactions in uranium

It looks more like a reactor than a bomb

Did he mention gaseous diffusion?

he seemed more focused on heavy water

as an intermediary?

yeah, instead of graphite

What is the matter?

misconduct

We're ahead We need your help, Niles

Excuse me, would you excuse us, gentlemen?

I didn't come here to help, Robert

I knew you could do it without me

So why did you come?

to talk about what follows

The power that will be revealed will last long after the Nazis

and the world is not ready

You must be ready for the snake's attack when you raise the rock

We must make the politicians understand that this is not a new weapon

It's a new world

I'll be there doing my bestbut you

You will become an American Prometheus

The man who gave them the powerto destroy themselves

and they will respect that

and your business will really begin

Sorry, Opie, you have a call

From San Francisco

Robert?

Robert?

Robert, Robert

Oh my God

What happened?

Her father called

They found her in the bathtub yesterday

from?

I took the pills

I left a message, unsigned

She took barbiturates, but there was chloral hydrate in her blood

There was a note

Jean Tatlock?

we were together

She said she needed me

I told her I wouldn't

I told her I couldn't

I know, I'm the reason

You don't get to commit to sin

And you make us feel sorry for you, because there were consequences

You pull ourself together

There are people who depend on you

Any input, Donald?

Please, help me - You're on your own, mate

I'm not quitting my job over radioactive plutonium, Bob

We don't know how it might affect the female reproductive system

It assumes that your reproductive system is more exposed to radiation than mine

Can we start?

The implosion device has stopped

You can't rush everything, Opie Please

There are "accelerate" and "continue", choose one of them

Wait, Niedermeyer's doing his job Teller's not helping

You don't lend a hand

I've been ordering implosion lens accounts for weeks

The British can do it Fox

certainly

It's your job, Teller

I am committed to research

With a hydrogen bomb that we didn't even build

I will not work with this man

Let him go, he's a primadonna

I agree, he should leave Los Alamos

Okay

Kesty, you are Niedermeyer's replacement

Seth, I'll charge you for the plutonium

Lily, work with Kesty, because he needs you

Fox, take on the role of Teller I'm going to charge you for the implosion device

And nobody leaves Los Alamos

They don't let me leave - No

I will not let you leave

Forget about Hans Forget about fusion

Stay here, find what you want

Fission, the hydrogen bomb, whatever Let's meet and discuss

You don't have time for meetings

You're political now, Robert

I quit physics years ago

once a week

one hour, both of us

Now lift the bar

So the "superbomb" research was under your supervision at Los Alamos?

Okay

However, after the war, I tried to deny that it was applicable

No, no, I indicated that there are technical difficulties regarding it

Didn't you try to stop it at the Atomic Energy Commission meeting after the Russian bomb test?

No - but that was a recommendation

From the Atomic Energy Commission, right? - after hours of discussion -

for the best response

and the hydrogen bomb

A thousand times more powerful than the atomic bomb

"Moscow"

Its only target will be the big cities

It is a weapon of genocide

Izzy, draw some circles on this side of the map

where they attack us

Starting with New York, Washington

It is an offensive weapon that has no defensive values

a deterrent tool - a deterrent tool? -

Do we really need more deterrence

From our current atomic arsenal?

She drowned in 10 feet of wateror ten thousand

what is the difference?

We can sink Russia already They know it

And now they can drown us - So we're just counting

Like I said, Teller's designs are still as impractical as they were in the war

A functional hydrogen bomb can be made Opie, you know that

I don't think we should devote all our resources to that opportunity

So how are you going to reassure Truman and the American people?

Simply by limiting the spread of nuclear weapons

Through international control over nuclear energy

And by which government do you mean?

The United Nations, as Roosevelt intended

Well, you asked what Truman should do, right?

The world has changed Fascism or communism no longer threatens our existence

Do you understand, Lois, that if wewe build a hydrogen bomb

That the Russians would have the option to build their own bomb?

Maybe they are working on one now?

Based on information we got from a mole in Los Alamos

There is no spy in Los Alamos

Let's not get off track, gentlemen No spy?

I say we should use this momentto win concessions from the Russians

By acknowledging that we will not build a hydrogen bomb

which reveals its existence

which you seem convinced to know

Good

At this point, I want the  committee members to meet privately

To finalize our recommendations

I'm not sure you want to go down this path

We're the advisory board, Lois, and we'll give our advice

good night

Dr. Oppenheimer? Welcome I'm William Borden

The Joint Commission on Atomic Energy?

Yes Yes

I was a pilot during the war

One night, I was returning from a raid, and I saw a majestic sight that looked like a meteor

An AV2 missile headed for England

I can't help it but I can only imagine what it's going to be

An enemy missile carrying an atomic warhead

Let's make sure we don't make that possible

Opie, I don't think you want to confront Strauss

If we both talk, they will listen to me

When you speak, they will listen to a prophet

And when Strauss speaks, they'll listen to themselves

They will listen to a prophet

The Prophet does not err, not once

Didn't you accuse Oppenheimer of sabotaging the devastating bomb?

I wasn't one to play with vocabulary like "vandalism"

But was Mr Borden like this?

As I understand it, this is possible

How could Mr Borden draw up such a detailed indictment?

He is no longer a government employee

Yet it turns out that he has unlimited access to Mr Oppenheimer's file

Perhaps Mr Nichols gave him access to the file?

Or someone else at the Atomic Energy Commission?

Senator, that's a serious accusation

Do you intend to imply that Dr. Oppenheimer is disloyal to the United States?

I always assumed, and still do, that he was loyal to the United States

I believe it and will remain a believer until I see definitive evidence to the contrary

Do you or do you think Dr. Oppenheimer poses a security risk?

“The impact of the technical apparatus on civilization”

And if I may, when Hitler blew his head off in that basement

In my humble opinion, there is no need for this bomb anywhere

Except for the test site

But at least we should stopfor a moment and think about

Whether the end justifies the means because

Germany is about to surrender

The greatest threat to humanity is no longer the enemy It is what we do

Hitler is dead, that's right

But the Japanese are fighting

Their defeat seems certain

Unless you're robot soldiers, ready to invade

We can end this war

But how will we justify the use of this weapon on humans?

We are theorists, right?

Yes Yes

We imagine a future, and our imagination makes us panic

But they are not afraid of it until they understand it

They will not understand it until they use it

When the world learns terrifying secrets about Los Alamos

Our work here will ensure human safety like you've never seen before

A peace that depends on the international cooperation Roosevelt always envisioned

Continue?

Is it worth two million dollars and two years?

It's hard to put a price on it

No, just add the bills

"Free access to rural areas"

Eighty children were born in the first year

And this year we had ten babies a month

Birth control is out of my power, general

clearly - General

All of you lower your heads

Keep your head down, Fox

This is a desired outcome

Two bombs can work I need an appointment

September"

July"

This is a wonderful place, gentlemen

‫"آب"

July"

The test is in July

But I need my brother

Frank knows the desert, he quit politics, and he's been with Lawrence for two years

What shall we call the test?

"Own my heart, O only God"

What?

"Holy Trinity"

You insisted on bringing your brother Frank, a known communist

Ex-communist

I brought a well-known ex-communist

To the largest and most important classified defense project in America

I know my brother can be trusted Sure

And did you feel that your judgment was correct about who on the team could be trusted?

Fox, put your head down

Well, everyone get ready

I hope you learned something

Yeah, we learned we should go further than that

Find a solution quickly

We'll leave for Washington in the morning We'll give them an appointment

You're far from Chicago, Leo

If we don't act now, they will use the invention against Japan

We scheduled a meeting with Truman, but someone screwed it up

You will meet the warlord

Just because we make them doesn't mean we decide how to use them

History will judge us, Robert

In Chicago, we started writing a petition together

I will not participate in that

Tell me your concerns and I'll pass them on

my fears?

Germany was "defeated"

And "Japan" will not stand alone

How do you know that? you got us into it

You and Einstein, and your letter to Roosevelt, mentioning our bomb-making capabilities

Against Germany

That's not how the gun industry works, Szilard

You have to lend a hand, Opie

Firmi and Lawrence are present at this meeting

They are not the same as you

You are the greatest marketer of science

You are good at persuading anyone and any commodity

Even yourself

I apologize

The firestorm in Tokyo killed a hundred thousand people

Most of them are civilians

I worry about America because we do these things and no one is protesting

Pearl Harbor and three years of brutal conflict in the Pacific

He made American public opinion suit us

Is it enough to launch an atomic bomb?

Maybe the atomic bomb's damage isn't as great as the Tokyo strikes

And what are our estimates?

In the size of an average city

Twenty or thirty thousand dead

Yes, but

Do not underestimate the psychological impact of an atomic explosion

A pillar of fire 10,000 feet tall

Deadly neutron effects a mile away, in all directions

produced by a single machine

It was shot down by a B-29 and hardly noticed

The atomic bomb will be

A terrible revelation of divine power

If this is true, it will be crucial

WWII will end

Our boys are coming home

What about military targets?

There are no goals big enough

Perhaps a vital war factory whose workers live nearby

We can issue a warning to minimize civilian casualties

they will send everything they have against us

and I'll be on that plane

But if we announce it and it fails

We will spoil any chance of the Japanese surrendering

Isn't there any way to show the Japanese the bomb to surrender?

We intend to show that in no uncertain terms

twice

one to show the strength of the weapon

The other is to show them that we can keep making this weapon until they give up

We have a list of twelve  cities to choose from

excuse me, eleven

I have crossed out "Kyoto" due to its cultural importance to the Japanese people

My wife and I also spent our honeymoon there

It is an amazing city

Let me make it easier for you, gentlemen

According to my information that I can'tshare with you guys

the Japanese people will not surrender

under any circumstances

Only a comprehensive and successful invasion of the mother islands

Many will lose their lives Americans and Japanese

Using the atomic bomb on Japanese cities will save lives

if we retain the moral advantage

How is that?

If we use this weapon without informing our allies

They will see it as a threat

We will have an arms race

How open can we be with the Soviets?

Secrecy did not prevent the Soviets from being part of the atomic world

We have learned that they do not have uranium

You have been misled

The Russian bomb is just a matter of time

The program should continue at full capacity after the end of the war

Minister Stimson, if I may

Not all scholarsin the project agree

In fact, this may be a moment to consider other opinions

if I happen to be a scientistthe Manhattan Project

was contaminated from the start

Some scholars of questionable estimation and uncertain loyalty

Someone tried to meet the president

Now, we need these guys

But once that becomes practical, any scientists should be dismissed from the programme

Don't you agree with me, Doctor?

if the Russian bomb is inevitable

Maybe we should invite their best scientists to Trinity?

President Truman does not intend to raise expectations

That Stalin will be among the atomic program

Inform him of our openness and offer it as a wayto win the war

No need to make promises that cannot be kept

But the Potsdam Peace Conference will take place in July

It will be President Truman's last chance to have that conversation

Can you give us a bomb until then?

Of course, we will do the test before the conference

Ground control, 10,000 yards away

North, south, and west

Where are we going to bomb?

south, 10,000 miles

And the base camp is ten miles south, here

And there is a look-out on that hill, twenty miles away

What is this, Frank? The launch lines are already marked

The Air Force ordered a line of lights for the B-29

Which B-29? Our bomb will be thrown from the tower

They want to use the test to determine a safe distance

This is a risk

Nothing more dangerous than throwing it over Japan

and hopefully we're right about radiation

Don't let them slow us down, we'll take the test on the 15th

Fifteenth? This isn't XV

Fifteenth

So I'll be at South Lookout with Frank and Kestaikowski

You will be assigned to Camp Camp, Western Lookout Point, or Outlying Point

Hey, gentle with the knife

Are these safe distances?

It is built according to your calculations

Time is behind you, Hans

Okay

What about the radiation cloud?

Without a strong wind, it may settle within two to three miles

Evacuation procedures are in place

But we need good weather to see So it must be good weather

Everyone out

We'll start the night of the fifteenth

It's a strict deadline, so if anyone has something to say, speak up now

Well, whoa, whoa, whoa

everyone, pillows

Put pillows under it

The final blast test can be used

it can't hurt

do it

Is there anything that can stop us?

It will happen, right?

I will send a message

If it goes as we want

Enter the sheets

Robert?

good luck

Obi put in three tons

- Teller bets 45 - Twenty tons

Twenty thousand tons of TNT

Is anyone of you betting on atmospheric ignition?

Are you saying we'll have to postpone?

say it would be wise

This weather reached the site?

A call from Beth notifying you that the implosion failed

Hi, Hans, yes, he's here

Okay

Is he wrong?

no no? -

both

So we're about to fail?

No Make it clear

Well, I can't, I just know

I know implosion lenses will work

If we fire these detonators and there is no reaction

A two-year supply of plutonium will be scattered in these white sands

A $10-a-month wager bet he says it'll explode

Oh, my God

Wind increases at zero, not rain

It is the sound of lightning

You think it's time to tell your men

To get away from the steel tower with the atomic bomb

Let's go to the southern lookout Pull them all out

We can get there

The team hasn't slept for two nights

If we stop and secure the bomb, we won't be back here for weeks

Then we'll miss Potsdam

I have to report to Truman by seven, or we miss our chance

what is going on?

It rains, the wind blows, it flashes

how long?

she is strong

It will recede before dawn

How do you know that? - I am familiar with the desert

The storm blows overnight Before dawn breaks, it subsides

He may be right, but schedule as late as possible

half past five

According to your predictions, if I'm wrong, I'll hang you

Tell everyone, Frank, 5:30

half past five

Three years, four thousand people, and two billion dollars

if it doesn't work

It will be over for both of us

I'm betting on three kilotons

Anything less will not give the desired result

What did Fermi mean by "atmospheric ignition"?

Well, we had a momentwhere it felt like

The chain reaction of the atomic device may not stop at all

Which leads to ignition of fire in the atmosphere

Why is Fermi still betting on it?

I take it as a joke

Hey, are you saying there's a chancethat when we hit that button

That we will destroy the world?

Nothing in our research over the past three years supports such a conclusion

except for the remote possibility

- What possibility? The chances are almost zero

Almost zero?

What do you want from theory alone?

zero would be acceptable

particulary

in 1 hour and 58 minutes

We will know

The storm is abating

The arming group has left the area They are heading in this direction

Throw away the keys

Start the cars, prepare for the emergency evacuation

Welding glass Let each man take his place

Everyone put the welding glass

Everyone put on welding glasses

twenty minutes

twenty minutes

that's twenty

on your leg, please

Feynman - No

Glass will block UV rays

And what stops the glass?

I'm going to base camp Good luck

Robert

try not to blow up the world

Watch that needle

if he doesn't charge the detonator

Or the voltage drops to less than  one volt

Press that button, and cancel the task

Concept? - Concept -

Two minutes before the explosion

Everyone lie down

Do not turn around until you see the light reflecting on the hills

Then look at the explosionjust through the welding glass

And now I have become death

Destroyer of worlds

It worked

You owe me ten dollars

Come on!

you too

yeah, you are

Done well

We succeeded! We succeeded

Done well

Connect me to Bodstam right away

Send a message to Kitty

We can't say anything

Tell her to get the sheets in

We succeeded, all of us!

Welcome?

- Hello, Kitty? What's up, Charlotte?

Here you go, Charlotte

I don't know, he just told me to tell you to get the sheets

kitty?

kitty? Do you still hear me?

If they detonate it high in the air, the effect of the explosion will not be strong

With respect, Dr. Oppenheimer, we'll proceed from here

Did Truman brief President Stalin on Potsdam?

It is possible that the reading is exaggerated

He introduced a new powerful weapon

And Stalin hoped we'd use it against Japan

Is that what's up?

Robert, we gave them an opportunity and it's up to them to seize it

Are you aiming for six?

The responsibility rests with the Commanding Officer Pacific

May I accompany you to Washington?

And for what?

You will keep me posted

certainly

to the best of my ability

Would the Japanese surrender if they knew what was coming?

I don't know

Did you see Szilard's petition?

What does Szilard know about the Japanese?

You wouldn't sign it, wouldn't you?

Lots of people signed it

Edward

In fact, we are in the making of this bomb

It does not give us the right and responsibility to decide to use it in a different way than others

But they are the only ones who know about it

I told Stimson different opinions of society

But what do you think?

Once the bomb is used

Nuclear war, and perhaps every war

You will become unthinkable

Until someone builds a bigger bomb than her

I thought they would call

It's only five

It's six in Japan

Charlotte?

Try calling Groves

Is there anything?

Charlotte?

Truman's on the radio!

16 hours ago

An American plane dropped a bomb on the city of Hiroshima

It destroyed resources of benefit to the enemy

The bomb carries over 20,000 tons of TNT explosive

It is an atomic bomb

It is a harnessing of the fundamental forces of the universe

Groves on the phone

We are now ready to destroy the Japanese quickly and completely

Hey general?

I am so proud of you and your people

Did you explode emotionally?

Obviously, it exploded with a huge sound

Everyone here feels very comfortable about it

It took a lot of time

I think the wisest thing I've ever done

When I was chosen director of Los Alamos

We have spent over $20 million

In the biggest scientific risk in history and we have won

Obi, Obi

This day will be immortalized in the memory of the world

It is too early to say what the results of the bombing will be

But I bet the Japanese don't like it

I am very proud

Very proud of what you've achieved

I wish we had them then to use them against the Germans

Dr. Oppenheimer?

Dr. Oppenheimer?

Nice pic

President Truman will see you now

Dr. Oppenheimer, what an honor

Mr President

Help yourself I thank you

Secretary Behrens

How do you feel when you are the most famous man in the world?

You saved many American lives

And what I did in Hiroshima was

in Nagasaki

Apparently your invention brought our boys home

It wasn't my invention in the first place

You're the one on the cover of Time magazine

Jim tells me you're concerned about the arms race in favor of the Soviet Union

Okay

Now is our chance to secure

International cooperation in the field of atomic energy and I am concerned

Did you know when the Soviet Union had the bomb?

I don't think I can

Absolutely, absolutely

Mr President, the Russians have great physicists and plentiful material

abundant?

Okay

I do not think so

They'll put everything they own and then

I heard you're leaving Los Alamos

What should we do with it?

Give it back to the Indians

Dr. Oppenheimer, if what you're talking about about the Soviet Union is true

We need to build Los Alamos, not shut it down

Mr President

I feel like I did the best I could

Do you think anyone in Hiroshima or Nagasaki cares who the bomb is?

They care who brought her down and I brought her down

You have nothing to do with Hiroshima

Dr. Oppenheimer

Don't allow that crying to come here again

Robert saw that worrying would get him nowhere

And when I met him

He accepted his reputation as the "Father of the Bomb"

And he used his profile to influence politics

Doctor, in the years after the war

Are you saying you have influence over the atomic policies of the United States?

I think it's a wonderful effect, and possibly an exaggeration

truly? If we consider the issue of nuclear isotopes

We are personally responsible for destroying every opposition by exporting it

You can use a beer bottle whenever you make an atomic bomb, you really can

I was the speaker, but the opinion was agreed upon among the scholars

All the while, McCarthy was getting stronger and he knew he was vulnerable

His brother was banned from universities all over the country

Lumanitz ended up working on the railroad

And Chevalier into exile

But none of that stopped Robert from continuing to push

Nuclear Energy Commission to recommend arms control over the H bomb

And he was devastated when Truman rejected their recommendation

I miss Richard more than I can stand

I know, Ruth, I know

Part of me rejoiced at his death and not seeing where all this was going on

Here comes the one who celebrates his birthday, go away

Have fun with it

My son and his fiancée would really like to meet the father of the atomic bomb, so

Have a good day

Is this an inappropriate time? What do you think, Louis?

It must have shocked you

A shock to the world

for the world? And what does Fox mean to the rest of the people in the world?

Fox, Klaus Fox

Oh dear, you haven't heard about it

It's Klaus Fuchs, the British scientist

Who put you on the implosion team at Los Alamos

It is assumed that he was

A spy for the Soviet Union all along

I regret it

After the truth about Fox came to light, the FBI's surveillance of him increased

He knew his phone was tapped

He was followed everywhere

They searched his trash

But he will not stop expressing his opinion

A man of principles

Perhaps he thought fame would protect him

When Eisenhower occupied the office He saw he had an opportunity

And I took it

We can compare "America" ​​and "Russia" to two scorpions in a bottle

Each is capable of killing the other, but must risk their own

There are different aspects to this policy

Many scholars blamed me, but how was I supposed to protect him?

Discussing this in the strictest confidence and frankness is the only remedy

Officials need to speak frankly with the American people

That was the last wrath of Robert's enemies

That is why he had to lose his security clearance

However, he lost his credibility

But how could they do that?

He was a war hero

He told everyone about his past

Borden conjured every piece of information

How did Borden get access to Oppenheimer's FBI file?

Could Nichols be the cause?

No, I don't imagine him doing that

But whoever did it just unleashed a firestorm

It swept all the way from the White House to my office at the IAEA

You see them there, right?

I worked my whole life to get here

The Cabinet of the United States of America is now facing the entire country

And they will return me to my place

A humble shoe salesman

Lois, we can win this thing

I think we can make the Senate think you did your homework

Although it was a painful duty

Now, will Hill's testimony back us up?

He will be fine I don't really know him

But it was one of Zilard's in Chicago

For not supporting their protest against bombing Japan

This took 31 days after the bombing

Almost everyone on the street who was a mile away from him

He suffered immediate and serious burns

The Japanese talked about people who wore striped clothes

The lines on their bodies were burnt

A lot of people thought they were lucky

Those who climbed out from under the rubble of their homes were slightly injured

But they died anyway

They passed away within days or weeks after that

As a result of the radium-like rays that were released in a large amount at the moment of the explosion

Did you see this absurdity in the papers?

A British scientist states that atomic explosions

It wasn't the final chapter of World War II

But it is the first chapter of the cold war with Russia

What world is this?

I think you know him, Patrick Blackett

Maybe he's wrong Right now Stimson tells me

That we bombarded an enemy, and it was defeated the worst defeat

Robert, you have all the influence right now

Please, encourage them to continue my search for the destructive bomb

I can't and I don't want to, Edward

why not?

It's a negative use of our resources

Is that what you really think?

J Robert Oppenheimer The mysterious atomic teacher

Nobody knows what you believe

aren't you like that?

And for the last time, our program director is Dr J Robert Oppenheimer

I hope in the coming years

You will look upon your work here with pride

But this pride today must be accompanied by great anxiety

If atomic weapons were to be added to the armoury of the warring world

The day will come when people will curse Los Alamos

Sorry, Admiral

I took the time to buy this

It looks very useful

It has Oppenheimer, what's the address?

"Strauass confronted J Robert Oppenheimer"

America won

That will work

These were your words from another day

We needed to change the approach

How will you know what Time magazine will write?

Henry Luce, my friend

You sat here and let me tell you how it happened

But you were way ahead

Living in Washington

It's about knowing how things happen

Good

And what did I say about Borden?

"Why were you arrested with a knife?"

I'm starting to think Borden was holding a knife for you

And it will depend on how much influence Borden has on Teller

Did I miss something funny?

It's Borden, Borden - And when we all know Strauss is the reason

Louis brought me to Princeton, Kitty

Then I humiliated him in front of Congress

But more useful than a sandwich

- How do I do it? - I'm going to take a 10-minute break

Maybe too much, Robert

This was six years ago

The principled

Patient like a saint

Strauss has made it clear that he's completely neutral

Wake up, it's Strauss

Strauss has always been, and you know that

Why don't you fight it?

Oh my god

It wasn't Nichols or Hoover or Truman, it was you

You gave the file to Borden, then directed it at Oppenheimer

- And his eyes - Borden

It didn't require any convincing

Take your time and use the entire file

Write down your conclusions and send them to the FBI

It is clear that there is a lot of material, but there is nothing new here

Your conclusions will be many

And they will have to be answered

Did Hoover turn them into McCarthy?

Oppenheimer's a little hard to get for this clown

I asked Hoover to put pressure on McCarthy while you work it out with the IAEA

- Trial both

No trial, you can't give Oppenheimer a tribune, you can't make him a martyr

We need a systematic destruction of Oppenheimer's credibility

So as not to repeat his talk about national security issues

So what is destruction?

A shabby little room away from the media

A simple bureaucratic procedure to renew his security clearance

You send your accusations to the FBI

Hoover sends it to the Atomic Energy Agency, and you have to act

Write down an indictment

You inform Oppenheimer that his security clearance will not be renewed

But he is given an opportunity to appeal

As you can see, Robert hasn't signed yet

May I keep these?

at all

If you decide to appeal, they will have to send you a copy

Whenever he makes an appeal, and believe me, he will

I will appoint a council

And of course it will include legal counsel

- Attorney General? Everything but the name

from?

Roger Robb

Rob will have security clearance to check the Oppenheimer file

The Gray Council would have it, and the Attorney General's attorney would not

Closed session, insulting and alleged information in your accusation against me

No audience, no journalists, no burden of proof

No burden of proof

We do not condemn

We just refuse

What did you miss?

"This is how the game is played"

Forgive me for my naivety

Amateurs who pursue the sun will be eaten

The strength lies in the shadows

But, sir, you are out of the shadows at the moment

Right, which is why this should work

Good

Teller will testify this morning

This will help us, and then

And Hale will testify tonight

Hale will help us, too

As you can see, Robert hasn't signed yet

- May I keep these? both

If you decide to appeal, they will have to send you a copy

Take my car and driver, I insist

I'm going to have to consult my lawyer, Louis

certainly

But don't take long

I can't get Nichols away from me

I'm sorry it has come to this point, Robert

I think that is wrong

Nichols wants me to fight him to write it all down

Strauss wants to push me away

Strauss knows you can do it

Accusations will be accepted

You will lose your job

And you will lose your reputation

And you will lose your home

You have to fight, Robert

As Attorney General of the Atomic Energy Agency, I cannot represent you

I'll call Lloyd Garrison

He's brilliant

It's the best, but I have to warn you

This wouldn't be a fair fight

When you met Boris Bash in 1943, did you talk about mini-films?

at all

11th tab, first page, third paragraph

Didn't you mention a man from the consulate who was an expert in mini-films?

Sorry both

I'd like to know what document Mr Robb is citing and if you can provide us with a copy

The document is not classified, Mr Garrison

I think we should take information from a first-hand source

This is a direct source

How is that, Roger?

There was a recording of the interview

You let my client sit here and potentially give false information

Do you have a recording from the beginning?

No one instructed your client to distort his previous answer

twist? It's been 12 years Shall we listen to the recording?

You don't have security clearance, Mr Garrison

But you read it on the record

Please, is this procedure focused on deception or the truth?

If he is focusing on the truth, where is the evidence? Where is the list of witnesses?

Mr Garrison, this isn't a trial, you know

And the rules of evidence don't apply here, we're dealing with national security

Yes, sir, with all due respect, I don't understand

How can national security prevent criminal prosecution?

Provide us with a list of witnesses - Maybe we need a short break

Gentlemen, I promise

If you say that the sayings are from a written text, I will accept that

I already explained how I made up a bogus story

Why would anyone fabricate such a complicated story?

Because I was an idiot

Why did you lie?

It is clear that the purpose was not to disclose the identity of the mediator

Your friend Haakon Chevalier, the communist

Am I still your friend?

Yes

Dr Raby, thanks for coming

Do you know of the others the prosecution called?

Honestly, Teller, they asked Lawrence

And what did he say?

It wouldn't have helped them but

- But - But

Strauss told him that you and Ruth Tolman have been cheating on your spouse for years

The whole time you lived with them in Pasadena

He convinced Lawrence that Richard died heartbroken

Can't believe it

- Which part? - Heartbreaker

Richard never knew about it

Will Lawrence testify?

I don't know

Dr Raby, what government positions do you currently hold?

Chairman of the General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission

Dr. Oppenheimer's successor

How long have you known Dr. Oppenheimer?

Since 1928 I know him well

Is your knowledge enough to talk about his sincerity and character?

Dr. Oppenheimer is a person of high moral character

He is loyal to the United States and his comrades

and to the institutions of which he is a part

all

who is that man?

Nothing to worry about

After the Russian atomic bomb test

Did Dr Lawrence come to see you about the H bomb?

You better ask him

I fully intend to ask him

Are you saying that Dr. Oppenheimer was a permanent opponent of the H bomb?

No, he thought the nuclear fusion program

It will degrade our excellent nuclear fission program

But it turns out that this is not the case

In the end, both can be accomplished

We assume this committee is not satisfied

About Dr. Oppenheimer's testimony that he was completely honest

What do you say about his acquittal or not?

And why are all these insults directed at a man who achieved what Dr. Oppenheimer achieved?

Look at his record

We have the atomic bomb and every chain of it

We have a detonator bomb and every chain thereof

What more do you want?

Nymphs?

But I've known Secretary Strauss for many years

I think it is necessary to express strong support

For what Lewis showed to science and scientists

We'll take a break unless there's immediate action

Senator, I would like to ask again

Provide a list of witnesses

I would like to remind the candidate that we are not always given this information in advance

We know Dr Hale will be here after lunch

Mr President, our next witness, Dr Lawrence, has colitis

Which is why we'll continue the procedure with William Borden for him

Welcome, Mr Borden, please be seated

Syed Borden

In your investigation of Dr. Oppenheimer, did you come to firm conclusions?

I got it

And did you ever express your conclusions in a letter to Mr J Edgar Hoover

At the FBI?

This is correct

Before writing the letter, did you discuss writing it with someone related to the Atomic Energy Commission?

I did not discuss it

Thanks, do you have a copy of the letter? I have one in front of me

Would you please read it for us, sir?

Dear Mr Hoover, The purpose of this letter is to express

Sorry, if I can

What is the purpose of repetition? He will simply read it

Mr President, this is the first time I see this message

And I see less data here than kind

Which I don't think anyone would like to see on record

There are accusations that have not been made in advance

Which is not part of Nichols' accusation

Kind of an accusation I don't think belongs here

The witness wrote the letter on his own initiative

Presents evidence that has already been presented to the committee

His conclusions are valid testimony

Like Dr. Oppenheimer's comrades' positive conclusions, it works both ways

How long has the letter been in the prosecutor's possession?

I don't think I should be accused for you to question me, Mr Garrison

Mr Garrison, since we're on the committee and we've all read the letter

Wouldn't it be better to be included in the record?

Let's go on reading it

"Dear Mr Hoover"

"The purpose of this letter is to express my opinion"

"Based on years of studying the available evidence, compiled"

More likely than not, J Robert Oppenheimer

He's an agent in the Soviet Union

The following conclusions are justified

"First, between 1929 and 1942 which is more likely than not"

J Robert Oppenheimer was a partisan communist

He even volunteered to provide information to the Soviet Union

Secondly, and it is more likely than not that he has since been working as a spy agent

Third, which is more likely than not

He has been operating under Soviet directives ever since

negatively affect the military policy of the United States

Sorry, Robert - "Atomic energy and intelligence"

- "and diplomatic politics" Is someone going to tell the truth

What is going on here?

And now we're going to hear from Dr David Hale

Dr Hale, will you give your statement?

I thank you

I was asked to testify about Lawrence Strauss

A man who has served for years in high government positions

He is known to be loyal, persistent and genius

The opinions I will give are my personal views

But I believe that what I'm about to say will help signal

To why most scientists in this country prefer to see Mr Strauss

completely out of government

You are referring to the hostility of some scholars

To Mr Strauss because of his security commitment

As described in the Oppenheimer case?

at all

It's because of the personal vendetta he's shown against Dr. Oppenheimer

system, system

It seems that most scientists in this country

And Robert Oppenheimer is currently being mocked

He is going through an ordeal because he expressed his honest opinions

Dr Bush, I thought I was doing my country a favor when I heard this case

There is no council in this country

He should judge a man because he has expressed his firm opinions

And if you like to try this case, give me a try

Sorry, gentlemen, if I'm upset, but I am

Dr Hale, we've already heard that Mr Strauss didn't press charges

Or participated in the hearings against Dr. Oppenheimer

The Oppenheimer affair began and ended with the enmity of Louis Strauss

Oppenheimer got the guys talking about Strauss's stance on

Isotopic shipments to Norway, and Strauss never forgave him for this public humiliation

Another dispute centered around their differences

in judging how seniors contribute to national security

Strauss resorted to the personal security system in order to destroy Oppenheimer's influence

Strauss managed to find ambitious men

They disagree with Oppenheimer's positions and envy him for his position in government circles

I assumed, and I still assume, that he was loyal to the United States

I believe it and will remain a believer until I see definitive evidence to the contrary

Do you or do you think that Dr. Oppenheimer poses a security risk?

On several occasions I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer

He behaved in a way that was very difficult for me to understand

I disagree with him on many issues

It seems to me that his behavior is confusing and complicated

To this extent I want the interests of this country to be

In hands I understand better and trust more

thank you Doctor I thank you

Sorry

Shake his evil hand?

I could spit in his face

I'm not sure the committee would have respected that

Isn't that polite enough for you?

I think you're being too sweet

Gray must see what Robb does Why not deter him?

Will you shake the towers again?

You have to stop playing the martyr

In accordance with the guidelines of the Atomic Energy Commission Are we exonerating Dr. Oppenheimer today?

According to my interpretation of the atomic energy law

which did not exist when I appointed Dr. Oppenheimer in 1942

I wouldn't clear him today if I were on the committee

Good, thank you, general, that's all

But I don't think I'm going to exonerate any of these people

That's it

Does Dr. Oppenheimer have any responsibility for the selection and filtering of class views?

No, not at all

And you would not leave this council today with any suggestion

That you question his loyalty to the United States at Los Alamos?

In any case, I hope I'm not leading anyone to believe otherwise for a moment

Thank you, General

You shouldn't have made them wait

She will be here

Would you even like her to be here?

Only fools and teenagers thinkthey understand other people's relationships

Not you, Lloyd

Me and Kitty

We are mature

We went through the hardest ordeals together

And you will do very well

Can you describe your views of communism as for, against, or neutral?

I am a staunch oppositionist and have had nothing to do with communism since 1936, and since

Since before I met Robert

That's it

The record proves that Oppenheimer did not warrant it

Neutral and unbiased advisors for the Gray Council

He was cross-examined by a prosecutor who used every trick from his astute legal background

You are now making the accusation that the Gray Council permitted a trial

If I were a member of the Gray Council, I would protest against the methods

The man who represented the public prosecution

A man who wasn't appointed by the council, but was appointed by Strauss

Who was this man?

Sorry?

Who was this man?

Roger Robert

Mrs Oppenheimer

Do you have a Communist Party membership card?

I'm not sure

Not sure?

Good

Good?

The process of joining the party is supposed to

Send money and receive card, right?

Okay

sorry

truly?

This was a long time ago Isn't that so, Sir Robert?

both Long time forgotten

Did you return the card or tore it up?

The card I forgot about?

Communist Party membership card

I have a slight idea

Is there a difference between Soviet communism and communism?

Back then when I was a member I thought they were two for sure

I thought the Communist Party in the United States

He was interested in our domestic problems, and I don't believe that anymore

I believe that all things are interconnected and expand across the world

I have believed this since I left the Party sixteen years ago

- But - Seventeen years ago

this is my fault

- But you said Sorry, eighteen years

eighteen years ago

Do you know that your husband was a participant in the Spanish Civil War until 1942?

I knew Robert gave away money from time to time

And did you know that this money was going to the activities of the Communist Party?

You mean by his activities?

Sorry?

I think you mean "through the Communist Party's bags," right?

Okay Okay?

Okay

Okay

Does this indicate that by 1942 your husband had not broken off his relationship with the Communist Party?

You are not obligated to answer "yes" or "no" You can answer however you like

I know that, thank you

Your question is not phrased correctly

Do you understand what I'm getting at? I understand that

Why don't you answer the question?

Because your sentence does not impress me

His relationship with the Communist Party

Because Robert never had anything to do with the Communist Party

I know he donated money to Spanish refugees

I know that he was mentally interested in the ideas of communism

Are there two types of communists?

The mental communist and your regular old communist?

I cannot answer this question

Nor can I

Good evening

Robert, you can't have that

It's a rigged trial with a preliminary result, so why drag yourself into any more of that?

I have my reasons

decent

Good night

He has a valid point

I'm not sure you understand, Albert

I don't understand?

I emigrated my country never to return

You served your country well

If this is a bounty for you, then

Maybe you should turn your back on her

Damn, I'm infatuated with this country

So tell them to go to hell

Oddly enough, it is no longer a confirmation hearing, but is now a trial

She is about to be tried

No good in telling everyone that you initiated the listening

He can't prove anything, and he definitely can't prove that I gave the file to Borden

We are not in court, sir There is no burden of proof

True, they will not condemn

They just refuse

Why would Hale come here and ruin my reputation? What are his intentions?

Do people need a reason to do something right?

- As he sees it I told you

Oppenheimer pitted the scientists against me from the very first meeting

I don't know what Oppenheimer told him that day

But Einstein didn't even look me in the eye

Oppenheimer knows how to control those around him

And in "Los Alamos" he took advantage of the scientists' naivety

Who thought they had a right to enforce how they managed their business

But they didn't think he was naive enough

Doctor, while you're working on the H-bomb

Did you refrain from doing something because of a moral motive?

Yes offcourse

But you're still going about your business, aren't you?

Yeah, because it was worth exploring and wasn't preparing a weapon

You mean he was way over an academic excursion

No, making a hydrogen bomb isn't academic

It's a matter of life or death

By 1942 you were actively pushing for the development of a hydrogen bomb, weren't you?

Payment is not an appropriate word, but support and work on it is true

Whenever that moral impulse becomes sober

At that time, you offered to develop the hydrogen bomb?

Whenever I suggest this is US policy

To make these things at any cost

Without any regard for the balance between these weapons

And atomic weapons are part of our arsenal

And what does the moral motive have to do with that?

What does the moral motive have to do with it?  Okay

Oppenheimer wanted to have the atomic bomb

He wanted to be the man who moves the earth

He talks about putting the nuclear genie back in the bottle

And I'm here to tell you that I know J. Robert Oppenheimer

And if he could do it everywhere, he would do it the same way

Do you know that he never once mentioned that he regretted Hiroshima?

He does it everywhere, why?

Because the bomb made him the most important person in history

We used the atomic bomb completely freely

And really, Doc, you helped set the target

To drop the atomic bomb on Japan, aren't you?

Okay

So you knew that by dropping the atomic bomb on the target I had identified

There are thousands who will be killed or injured, is that right?

Yes, not as many as shown

How many were killed or injured?

seventy thousand

Seventy thousand in Hiroshima and

One hundred and ten thousand in both cities

bombarded every day

Okay

And the weeks and years that followed?

It's somewhere between 50 and 100,000

- 220 thousand at least?  Okay

And what moral motive concerns you about that?

Terrible motives

But you testified that the bombing of Hiroshima was a success

In practice he was successful

In practice it was very successful

Allegedly, it helped end the war

Were you helping drop the hydrogen bomb on Hiroshima?

This is not logical at all

Why?  The target is very small

Suppose there was a bigger place in Japan.

Big enough for a thermonuclear weapon, would you have opposed dropping it?

This was not the problem I had

I confront you with it now, sir

It wasn't part of his plan

He was fighting the hidden and glorious guilt of the arrogant in order to feel great

"We can't go down this road," he says.

Even if he knew we'd have to

Would you oppose dropping a thermonuclear weapon on Japan?

Because of troubling moral motives?  - I believe I will object, sir

Did you oppose dropping an atomic bomb on Hiroshima because of ethical concerns?

We presented our arguments

- I ask you, not us, but you - I have given my arguments

towards dropping the bomb, but I didn't agree to them

You mean after you've been working day and night for three years on making the bomb

And then you argued about using it?

The Secretary of War asked me about the visions of the scholars at the time

I gave him visions for and against us

You supported the dropping of the atomic bomb on Japan.

What do you mean by "support"?

- You supported dropping the bomb - What do you mean by "support"?

You helped choose the target, didn't you?

I did my job, not in an executive position at Los Alamos.

I would do everything asked of me

And you were going to make a hydrogen bomb too, aren't you?

- I couldn't - I didn't ask you, Doctor

And the report of the advisory committee that you contributed to after it showed the Russian atomic bomb test

The destructive bomb must not be made

What we meant, what I meant was

- You meant what?  from?  - What I meant

Wouldn't he have moved the Russians to increase their power?

If we do it, they will have to do it

And our efforts will stimulate their efforts, as happened with the atomic bomb

Just like with the atomic bomb.

There was no moral motive in 1945 and not much in 1949.

Dr. Oppenheimer

When did you develop your firm convictions regarding the hydrogen bomb?

Whenever you explain it to me

We intend to use any weapon we have

J Robert Oppenheimer, the martyr, gave him exactly what he wanted

And to be immortalized in Trinity, not Hiroshima or Nagasaki.

He had to thank me

He will not thank you

We still have enough votes

Or is the crowning moment of my career about to be the most public humiliation of my life?

Almost the entire council will vote

- It's going to be a hit - Great, then get the press together

Dr. Oppenheimer

This council has heard your testimony

And many of your former and present comrades

The council has come to the unanimous conclusion that you are a loyal citizen

However, given your ongoing engagements

And your disregard for the security services in this country

Plus your somewhat annoying behavior about the atomic bomb program

And what you lack in answers and frankness towards this Council

We voted two to one against renewing your security clearance

A full book will come out with an objection

From Mr. Evans to the Atomic Energy Commission in the coming days

That's it

Council member

Robert

Robert

Do not wash the sheets

Take a picture of it

Sir, sir

Two minutes, two minutes

- You'll have your picture - Please, sir

- We've been waiting a long time. - Good afternoon, sir

- Get out - sir

Is it an official meeting?

There were two people we didn't expect to stick with their opinion

I was rejected, right?

I regret that, sir

decent

Who were these two Egyptians?

There were three led by the junior senator from Massachusetts.

And a young man who wants to prove himself and doesn't like what you did to Oppenheimer

What is his name?

Kennedy

John F Kennedy

Kitty?

Did you think that if you let them apply the "paint and feather" penalty to you?

Will the world forgive you?

He will not forgive you

We will see that

You told me I'd be fine

I didn't have all the facts, did I?

Here's a fact

President Eisenhower placed the Medal of Freedom on my chest last year

Because I've always done what's best for this country

Don't they want me in the cabinet?

It's okay

Maybe they should invite Oppenheimer for me

Maybe they will call him

I told you that he turned scientists against me one by one, starting with Einstein.

Einstein, I saw him by the pond

Indeed, but you know, sir

Because no one knows exactly what they said to each other that day

Is it possible that they never talked about you?

Is it possible that they were talking about something?

more important?

Mr. Strauss

Here, Mr. Strauss

I thank you

Albert

event man

Once upon a time you received me

At Berkeley, and you've given me a bonus

correct

You all thought I lost the ability to understand what I started

The reward was not mine, but all of you

Now it is your turn to deal with the consequences of what you have achieved

And one day when they punish you enough

They'll serve you salmon and potato salad

Thank you, my dear

They give you a medal

Frank

Your joy is my joy

I'll be back, tell everyone I forgive them

Just remember

It won't be for you

It will be for them

When I came to you with those calculations

We thought we might start a chain reaction
that would destroy the entire world

- I remember it well

- What of it?

I believe we did
