How long, Lieutenant?

We need to run a new cable, sir.
They're scrambling.

Very well.

Colonel, you're gonna have to decide
how many more wounded to evacuate.

One stretcher takes the space
of seven standing men.

Excuse me.

COMMANDER BOLTON: Rear Admiral.
REAR ADMIRAL: Commander.

How's the perimeter?

Shrinking every day.

But between our rear guard
and the French, we're holding the line.

And the enemy tanks have stopped.

Why have they stopped?

Waste precious tanks

when they can pick us off from the air,
like fish in a barrel?

How long does London expect the army
to hold out before we make terms?

Make terms?

They're not stopping here.
We need to get our army back.

Britain's next
and then the rest of the world.

COMMANDER BOLTON: Christ.

I mean, you can practically see it
from here.

What?

Home.

What about the French?

Publicly, Churchill's told them,
"Bras dessous."

Arm in arm, leaving together.

COLONEL WINNANT: And privately?

We need our army back.

How many men
are they talking about, sir?

Churchill wants 30,000.
Ramsay's hoping we can give him 45.

There are 400,000 men
on this beach, sir.

REAR ADMIRAL:
We'll just have to do our best.

Right, well, this mole stays open
at all costs.

We're in artillery range from the west.
If anything else sinks here,

the mole's blocked and we're stuffed.

Can't we load from the beaches?

Better than standing out here
when the dive bombs come.

- It's impossible.
- Too shallow?

'Cause anything that drafts
over three feet can't get near.

We don't have enough small boats
to ferry men to the destroyers.

REAR ADMIRAL: (SIGHS)
The mole it is, then, gentlemen.

Hey!

Hey! Can you swim it?

Dad, can you get closer?

Can't risk it!

Fortis 2, what's your fuel?

There'll be one soon.

(CHUCKLES)

One?

it's one ship on the mole at a time.

The battle is here.

What the hell are they saving them for?

The next battle.

The one for Britain.

It's the same with the planes.

But it's right there.

You can practicallyâ€”

Seeing home doesn't help us
get there, Colonel.

They need to send more ships.

Every hour the enemy pushes closer.

They've activated
the small vessels pool.

Small vessels?

It's the list of civilian boats
for requisition.

Civilian?

We need destroyers.

Small boats can load from the beach.

Not in these conditions.

Well, I'd rather face waves
than dive bombers.

No, you're right.
They won't get up in this.

The Royal Engineers are building piers
from lorries.

At least that should help us
when the tide comes back.

Well, we'll know in six hours' time.

I thought the tides were every three?

Then it's good that you're army
and I'm navy, isn't it?

There. Vanquisher.

HIGHLANDER 1: Probably got spooked
after they ran aground.

Scarpered up the beach.

'Cause we're outside the perimeter.
Enemy could be right there.

best shut ourselves inside, boys.

Wait for the high tide.

How long's that?

Every three hours.

Dad, is that one of ours?

That's a Heinkel.
They'll go for that minesweeper there.

Hang on. Shouldn't we stand by

To do that we have to survive ourselves.

We don't need a volunteer.

I know someone who ought to get off.

This one.

He's a German spy.

Don't be daft.

He's a fucking Jerry.

Have you noticed he hasn't said a word?

'Cause I have.

He don't speak English.

If he does it's with an accent

You're daft. Tell him.

Who's Gibson, eh?

Some naked, dead Englishman
lying out on that sand?

Did you at least have the decency
to bury him?

TOMMY: He did. I helped him.
I thought it was his mate.

- ALEX: Maybe he killed him.
- He didn't kill him.

How do we know?

How hard is it to find a dead Englishman
on Dunkirk beach?

He didn't kill anyone.

He was just looking for a way
off the sand, like the rest of us.

(GUN FIRING)

Haven't they had enough practice
by now?

They're trying to make sure
she won't float.

Will she still float?

Float, yes. Yes, with less weight.

And we know who's getting off.

No, you can't do that.
He's French. He's on our side.

Go on. Up you go.

As soon as he pokes his head out,
they'll slaughter him.

Better him than me.

It's not fair.

Survival's not fair.

HIGHLANDER 1: No, it's shit.

It's fear, and it's greed.

Fate pushed through the bowels of men.

Shit.

He saved our lives.

And he's about to do it again.

- (GRUNTS)
- No, don't! Stop!

Somebody's gotta get off,
so the rest of us can live.

If you wanna volunteerâ€”

Fuck no.

I'm going home.

And if this is the price?

I'll live with it.

But it's wrong.

HIGHLANDER 1: Go on!

One man's not going to make
enough difference.

You'd best hope it does,

We let you all down, didn't we?

Christ, how many you got in there?

MAN: Make your way to the trains.

SOLDIER: Where the hell were you?

They know where you were.

Bye.

MAN: Cup of tea?

Cup of tea?

BLIND MAN: Well done. Well done.

Well done, lads.

Well done. Well done, lads.

Well done.

All we did is survive.

That's enough.

(BLIND MAN CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

Well done.

Well done.

That old bloke wouldn't even
look us in the eye.

COMMANDER BOLTON: Come on, private!

I know we're officers,
but it's us or the enemy.

So now is not the time to be particular.

Well, Churchill got his 30,000.

And then some.

Almost 300,000.

(INHALES DEEPLY)

So far.

So far?

I'm staying.

For the French.

ALEX: Hey!

Where are we?

Siding. You'll be pulling in
in a minute.

What station?

Woking.

Grab me one of them papers.

Go on!

Can't bear it.

You read it.

Can't bear it?

They'll be spitting at us
in the streets.

If they're not locked up
waiting for the invasion.

"Wars are not won by evacuations."

(KNOCKING ON WINDOW)

I can't look.

"But there was a victory
inside this deliverance,

"which should be noted.

- (CLINKING)
- (CHEERING)

"Our thankfulness at the escape
of our army

"must not blind us to the fact
that what has happened

"in France and Belgium
is a colossal military disaster.

(FARRIER GRUNTS)

"We must expect another blow
to be struck almost immediately.

"We shall go on to the end.

"We shall fight in France.

"We shall fight on the seas and oceans.

"We shall fight with growing confidence
and growing strength in the air.

"We shall defend our island
whatever the costâ€”"

What?

"We shall defend our island
whatever the cost may be.

"We shall fight on the beaches.

"We shall fight
on the landing grounds.

"We shall fight in the fields
and in the streets.

"We shall fight in the hills.

"We shall never surrender.

"And even if this island
or a large part of it

"were subjugated and starving,

"then our Empire beyond the seas,
armed and guarded by the British Fleet,

"would carry on the struggle

"until, in God's good time,

"the New World,
with all its power and might,

"steps forth to the rescue
and the liberation of the old."
