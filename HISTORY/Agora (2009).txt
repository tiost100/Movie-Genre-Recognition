In the late fourth century C.E.
the Roman Empire began to crumble.

Alexandria, in the province of Egypt,
still retained some of its splendor.

She possessed one of the Seven
Wonders of the ancient world:

the legendary lighthouse,
and the biggest known library.

The library was a not only
a cultural but a religious symbol,

a place where the pagans worshiped
their ancestral gods.

The traditional pagan worship
in the city now co-existed with the Jews,

and an unstoppable religion,
up until now banned, Christianity.

How many fools do you think
have asked themselves?

Why don't the stars fall from the sky?

But you,
who've had the teachings of the wise,

You know that the stars
move neither up nor down,

they merely revolve from east to west,

following the most perfect
course ever conceived.

The circle.

Because the circle reigns in the heavens,

the stars have never fallen
and they never will.

But,

what about here, on Earth?

Here, bodies do fall.

But their movements are not circular,
but linear.

Watch again.

Watch again.

No, leave it. Leave it.

So.

What mysterious wonder, do you all think,

might be lurking beneath the Earth
that would make every single...

person and animal
and object and slaves settle there?

What might it be?

The heaviness, lady.

No.

Synesius.

Their weightiness.

No, you're both speaking about
the same thing, but you're not...

talking about the primary cause.

Have any of you ever wondered
at the thought that your...

your feet...

your feet...

are standing...

on the very center of the cosmos,

that holds, all things together
and pulls them together.

If there were no center,
then the universe would be...

shapeless, infinite, formless,

chaotic.

Will it make a little difference if
we were here or there or anywhere?

And we'd all be better off
never having been born.

Our God, Our Father,

Lord of the universe,

origin of all things,

eternal force of the cosmos,

where everything has its beginning
and everything its end.

Almighty Serapis, Isis, Horus,

Anubis and all the other gods
we ask for your protection.

Both in heaven and on earth.

Orestes...
If you would just let me speak. Please.

I know you feel something as well.
I've seen.

I've seen.

Tell the master we're leaving.

Can you believe?
He was courting me,

as if I'm one of his conquests.

This Orestes is as foolish as his father.

I already suggested that he devote
his heart to another muse,

one more beautiful than I.

Who?
Music.

Music?

You do not find it amusing?

But how could,

227 ever become 16?

Look at this, it's 14.

They, they behave like humans!

They eat, drink and fornicate!

If my gods eat, drink and fornicate,
good for them.

Know this, know this...

you who console yourself
with pagan images.

Men, women, birds, reptiles!

Serapis!

Serapis!

Who could trust the God,
with a flower pot for a crown?

Hey you, Christians,

how arrogant you'd become now
that the empire allows you to exist.

My father's father saw them,

slaughtered in the circus
and fed to the lions.

Enough! Enough!

Watch.

Watch.

I shall now walk across the fire.

If my God...

If my God is the true god,
I shall suffer no harm.

If however your gods exist,

they will roast me like a pig.

You...

You're mad!

You'll get what you deserve.

Now let's see,
if you can walk cross the fire.

What are you doing?

Stop! Stop! Stop! You can't do that.
Let the man go.

Be quiet pagan, or we'd call you in as well.

Whose is this?

Whose is this?

How many times must I repeat myself?

Today,

the Christians burned a man,

right in the middle of the Agora!

I will not have this in my house!

Not in the house of Theon!

Give it to me.

Give it to me!

Master, I beg mercy for your slave girl.

Davus!
Get up.

You have nothing to do with this.

I too, am a Christian.

What did you say?

I too, am a Christian.
Punish me for the both of us.

So, now they presume to teach us mercy.

Get a whip.
Father!

Please wait until you calm before you...

Father, I beg of you.

I beg of you.

Wrapped in a blazing brightness.

It was the flames, stupid.

Then why didn't he burn like the pagan?

Tell me.

Leave us!

Come here.

And kneel.

Tell me, is it true that you're a Christian?

I don't know what to say, Mistress.

Why not?

If I said yes,

that would be a lie.

If I said no, that'd mean
I lied to my master.

I don't know which one's worst.

Then you should say nothing at all.

There.

Thank you.

I want you to know that the Master
is upset with himself about this.

What is that?

Something I made, Mistress.

But it looks like a...

What is it?

It's Ptolemaic System.

It is.

Did you make this?

Earth,

is the center of the cosmos...

and revolving around it,

the Sun,

and the five wanderers: Mercury,
Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.

Obstinately disobeying the law of the circle.

Nevertheless, Ptolemy shows
us that they do obey.

The fact that we see them move,

in a loop...

is due to the joint effect of two circles.

One that...

travels around the Earth,

and another lesser circle,

proper to each wanderer.

Look, epicycles.

So you see it's not Heaven that errs.

But our eyes that deceive us.

Well said Davus.

I'd like you to know that your exposition
shows me that you've been paying,

closer attention than...

one or two...

others here.

I tell you the gods should have consulted me
before they created anything.

Why do you say that, Orestes?

It all seems so whimsical!

Why the joint effect of two circles?

Wouldn't it be more...

perfect if the wanderers didn't wander...

and a single circle gave sense to everything?

Orestes, by what authority
do you judge the work of God?

What is wrong with you, Christians?

Can a man no longer open
his mouth in this city?

If you criticize creation, you
criticize our Lord and you offend us.

You should move out to the desert.

You won't hear anything
to offend you out there.

You know nothing of what you speak.

None of you.

Synesius, what is Euclid's first rule?

Why the question?

Just...

answer me.

If...

if two things are equal to a third thing...

then they are all equal to each other.

Good.

Now, are you both not similar to me?

Yes.

And you, Orestes?

Yes.

Now, I'm actually saying this
to everybody here in this room.

More things unite us than divide us.

Now, whatever maybe going on in
the streets. We are brothers.

We are brothers.

I want you to remember that brawls
are for slaves and for riff-raff.

Now I think we should all honor Davus
with some very well earned applause.

So.

He'll judge us, all alive and dead.

And then it will be too late,

because only those who believed in Jesus,

will be saved.

What are you waiting for?

What are you waiting for?

The Kingdom of God is upon us.

Do you understand what I'm telling you?

Yes.

Yeah but do you understand, like men do?

Do you nod your head like sheep?

What are you looking at?

Yes, you.

What are you looking here?

Are you Ammonius?

The man who performed the miracle?

Do you want to see a miracle?

Are you the one?

I am.

Come with me.

Jesus went throughout Galilee,

teaching in their synagogues.

Preaching the good news to the Hebrew,

and healing every disease or sickness.

News about him spread among the Syrians,

and people moved to him from
all over the world.

That is Theophilus.

The bishop.

For theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.

Blessed are those who mourn,

for they will be comforted.

Blessed are the meek,

for they will inherit the earth.

Blessed are they which do hunger
and thirst for righteousness,

for they will be filled.

The word of God!

Blessed are the merciful,

for they will be shown mercy.

Blessed are the pure in heart,

for they will see God.

The Lord be with you.

So how are you able to escape the flames?

The Lord be with you.
And with you.

What do you think I did?

I prayed.

You probably, do not even know how?

What do you have in that sack?

Do you have any food here?

It's for my Master.
It's for my Master!

What's wrong with you?

I have to pay for that with my own money.

What do you need money for?

Look at their faces.

Here.

I want you to try it yourself.

And afterwards,

I will teach you how to pray.

Go on.

The Lord be with you.

Bless you.

See?

That is a miracle!

Go on,

keep doing it.

The Lord be with you.

Please.

Thank you.

Bless you,

God bless you.

Bless you.

Hey, slave!

What is your name?

Davus.

Davus the slavus!

Now, you look like a true Parabalani.

A true soldier of Christ.

What are they saying this time?

Telling them to dance.

The men are now heavy with wine.

All aboard!

Oh, what an unfortunate wretch.

Save your servants!

End of act 2!

Thank you, dear audience, thank you.

Now excuse the delay while we move things
around and change our costumes.

Good evening.

Forgive, forgive my boldness.

I am Orestes, son of Orestes.

I'm here...

to...

I'm here to declare my love
for Hypatia, the philosopher.

Whom you all, no doubt, know.

Some time now following her counsel.

I have devoted myself to music.

In the hope of seeking solace,
in the harmony of its sounds.

But for me,

such harmony resides only in my lady.

So,

My purpose here is merely to...

offer my melody...

in the hopes of...

Stop talking.

That man will go far, I tell you.

He's my preferred fruit
for the banana not the fig,

I would have already fallen at his feet.

Wouldn't it be best to please him?

Me?

How?

Granting him your daughter's hand.

Why don't you ever plan to marry her off?

Hypatia subject to a man?

Without freedom to teach?

Or even to speak her mind.

The most brilliant philosopher I know,

having to give up her science.

No, that could be death to her.

That's true.

Her work is admirable.

And she's prudent and virtuous.

But Theon,

those are yet her fathomed wishes.

Being a woman, I mean.

Our Father who art in heaven.

Don't let anyone else have her.

Please, don't anyone else have her.
Don't anyone else have her.

Don't let anyone else have her.

Amen.

Good day, lady.

Good day, lady.

Good day, lady.

Good day lady.

Yesterday, many of you will have seen
one of your colleagues

present me with an aulos.

I accepted the gift.

And today I wish to make him earn,

a gift of my own in return.

This is for you.

It is the blood of my cycle.

Orestes you...

You say that you have found harmony in me.

Well, I am suggesting that you look elsewhere
because I think that there is little...

harmony or...

beauty in that.

Don't you agree?

Yesterday we were discussing
the Apollonian cone.

We discussed the circle,
the ellipse, the parabola.

Today we will discuss the hyperbola.
Lady!

Forgive me, Lady.

Olympius requires your presence
urgently in the Serapeum.

You as well.

Thank you, Lord.

Thank you, Lord.

Thank you, Lord.

How are we to enjoy them force feeding us,

the faith and customs to people
who until recently becoming outlaws?

What's happening?

It's despicable. A sacrilege.

Christians have gathered in the Agora.

They are mocking the gods.

We must put an end to these insults!

They may not fear him,

but they will fear our swords.

Wait!

Wait!

Now, what is it you are going to do?

Are you going to attack them?

Are you going to stain your hands
with blood for an insult?

To the gods!

An insult to the gods!

Well, if you think it is so outrageous

then go and denounce their
acts before the Prefect.

One might think that you're protecting them.

I am trying to protect our disciples.

You, are inciting them
to be violent murderers.

Theon, as director, you have the last word.

The insult must be answered.

Those Jews amongst you do as you please.

This is not your battle.

As for you Christians,

you would do well to join
those of your own fate.

You will not cast my disciples
out of this house!

Glory be to Serapis!

And all the gods!

Wait for my command!

No one must suspect us
until we have them surrounded.

The clubs are for the slaves.

Slaves!

The slaves are also summoned!

Davus, go back.

No. Go back.

Go back.
Death to Christians!

Glory be to Serapis!

Let's listen to her now!

Do you hear any complaint?

No!

This one has lost her voice too!

Their mouths do not speak,

their eyes do not see,

their noses do not smell.

Yet still, pagans come here
and kneel before them.

What madness is this?

For the gods!

Medorus!

Take care of your master!
Protect him!

God is one!

Death to the pagans!

You! What are you looking at?
Get there and fight!

Fight!

Are you deaf?
I said fight!

I'm a Christian!

I am a Christian!

I am a Christian!

God is Christ!
Christ is one!

Death to the pagans!

God is one!

No!

No!

The entrance!
We must defend the entrance!

What's happening?
What's happening?

Our men are being sent back
by the Christians!

Father!

It's alright.
It's alright.

What happened?

It was his slave.

Davus, get me some cloth
some water, quickly.

Father.

Synesius, we must get out of here.

Hold him still.

The Parabalani are coming!

God is with us!

Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!

Close the gates!

You know our men are still out there!

May the gods protect them.

Close the gates, I say!

Don't kill him!

We'll keep him as a hostage like the others.

Did you hear that, everyone?

Any Christian you catch is now a hostage.

Take our wounded to the temple and
the Christians down into the cellars.

And anyone with a good eye
and a good aim, up on the walls.

Olympius.

This one is a Christian.

Yes, and those three as well.

If they are Christians,

they will go down to the cellars.

Olympius, if you are going
to imprison my brothers,

then you are going to have
to imprison me with them.

If it is necessary, I will do that.

If anyone,

anyone,

dare lay a finger on one of my brothers,

I swear I'll run it through.

Look!

Look at this!

Orestes.

Thank you.

Since when were there so many Christians?

We'll talk to them to negotiate.

What are we waiting for?

What can we expect from
a Christian emperor?

Except be put to the sword.

I'll settle for still being alive
when his verdict arrives.

Here will do.

No one should leave the group,

please.

Are they going to pray all night?

Davus. Davus.

Stay here.

It's safer here.

Just stay with him first.

Synesius, what are you doing?

Lady, sister and mother,

May God bless you and protect you.

Move back!

Slaves back, take it to the back.

Slaves get to the back!

The three won't come out.

It's a disaster.

Father, why don't you leave the dice?

Have you been seen today?

No.

No?

I'll just have a look.

Promise me my child that...

when I'm gone,

you won't remember this foolish old man.

I promise.

Remember me as I was before.

Before when I could still think and...

I...

work with you,

and...

I listen to you.

How could, I have been so wrong and...

Seeing you here locked
up because of me and...

Father please.

I wanted you to be free.

I am free.

Hey, Christians.

Christians!

What's that confident God
of yours doing now?

Maybe coffins for you, scums!

So, tell me.

Where are the gods now?

Where are they?

Might as well look for others.
Others?

Which one?

The God of the Christians perhaps?

Such boldness!

What do you think, Lady?

Am I so bold?

Put the fire out.

You are indeed bold.

Very bold.

I've been thinking about
something you said to me.

Me?

That day that you,

criticize the heavenly mechanism
and you called it,

whimsical.

Yes, although...

Actually...

I was criticizing Ptolemy.

For complicating everything with his epicycles.

I don't know perhaps I'm just simple-minded.

No.

No, the heavens...

should be simple.

So, am I right or?

What if...

What if there were simpler
explanations for the wanderers?

There is.

But it is so absurd, so old.

That no one gives it any credit.

What theory is that?

Do you think of Aristarchus?

Aristarchus maintained,

that the earth moves.

The strange behavior of the wanderers,

was nothing more than an optical illusion,

caused by our movement,

in combination with Earth,

around the sun.

Heliocentric model.
That's right.

The sun would be in the center acting
as speaking of it as King of the Stars.

It would make Earth just...
His work was lost,

another wanderer.

In the fire that destroyed the mother library.

This is why we have to take
great care of this place.

Our library, is all that remains
of the wisdom of men.

But every time you drop an object here.

Who speaks?

Forgive me, Mistress.

I was listening.

Speak up, Davus.

If the earth is moving,

every time dropping an object it would,

fall further behind.

And the wind would always blow against us.

And the birds would lose their way in flight.

I told you, Aristarchus' hypothesis,

makes no sense at all.

I feel that what you just said can be refuted.

But right now I don't know how.

Make way for the Prefect!

Make way!

Make way for the Prefect!

Make way!

Listen one and all!

Prepare to hear and obey
the verdict of our Emperor.

I, Flavius Theodosius Augustus,

Emperor and Supreme Head
of the provinces of the Orient,

having been informed of the events,

which recently took place
in the City of Alexandria,

do hereby declare and command,

that the insurgents
shall be pardoned and freed.

In exchange for my generosity,

the insurgents will abandon the Serapeum

and the Library immediately,

allowing the Christians to enter
and dispose off the premises...

as they see fit.

What are we to expect?

They'll destroy everything!

The pagans will leave by the stables.

The Books.

From there, you will be escorted
to your homes.

Obey this, instant!

Keep it together!

Send half of the regiment to the other side.

And send the rest later.

Yes, sir.

Prefect.

We won't be able to contain
this lot for long.

For Christ! For Christ!

Stay together!

<font color="#ff8000">HE ISTORIA</font>

<font color="#ff8000">HE FILOSOFIA</font>

<font color="#ff8000">TO DRAMA</font>

Leave the lesser works.

Which are the lesser works?

Just take the important ones.
The important ones.

The soldiers are withdrawing!

Slave!

Have you seen my mistress?

Just get over here and help!

They're not carrying so many.

We need more help.

Please go and get my father out of here.

Get him out of here now.

Slave!

Go! Go! Go! Go!

Come on, quickly!

Hypatia, her students, are still in the atrium.

Are they out of their minds?

If that's what they want, let them burn.

Come on!

Quickly!

Lady.

Where have you been?

Pick up that sack.

Lady we have to go.

Pick up the sack!

Why are slaves never around
when you need it?

I was...
Move! Move, move your feet! Move!

Idiot!

Run!

There is no time!

There is no time!

Lady!

Leave them.

God is one!

Davus!

Davus, where are you going?

We have to go!

Davus, where are you going?

If he wants to die for our gods, let him.

Please, no.
Please don't do this.

Come on!
Davus!

Davus, no!
Come on!

God is one!

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!

Slave!

Davus!

Davus!

Davus the slavus!

Help me with this!

Help me!

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!

Pagan sinners!

The Master's wound, is festering.

I know.

I know.

Davus.

Davus!

You're free.

Go.

Henceforth in Alexandria,

only Christian and Jewish worship
shall be permitted.

Pagan sacrifices,

worshipping pagan symbols,

and visiting pagan temples
shall no longer be allowed.

Should anyone commit such an act

or dare raise his eyes to the statues,

of his former gods,

he shall be punished without clemency.

After taking the library,
many pagans were converted.

and for a period Alexandria
lived in peace.

Hipatia continued teaching
and researching,

and her former students
held key posts in the social elite..

The Empire was forever split in two.

Many Christians saw this
as a sign of the world's ending,

and decided to prepare
by practicing a more holy life.

The order of Parabalani monks
was charged,

to patrol the streets
and maintain Christian morality...

now disturbed by the presence of the Jews.

The Library, years later.

Damn Jews!

Damn Jews!

They're just a bunch of good for
nothing thugs, packed animals!

Joran, my dear friend, calm down.

Let Bishop Cyril speak in his own defense.

Prefect,

our blessed Parabalani,

whom he has just called,

Beast of Burden.

Devote themselves true
enough to carrying burdens.

crippled, the sick, the lepers...

And stones!

Prefect they carry stones.

And now they burst into the theatre,

and stone us,

knowing we will do nothing
to defend ourselves.

Because it is the Sabbath!

On the Sabbath, you should honor God,

in your synagogues instead of stuffing
yourselves with sweets at the theatre.

That is why the stones fell upon you.

Prefect, do you hear that?

Now, he's threatening us.
This is too much.

Friends, there are more things
that unite us than divide us.

We are brothers!
We're all brothers.

Where would you Christians be
without the Jews?

Jesus was a Jew!

Jesus was a Jew!

There is, something I find disturbing
in what you've told me.

What?
Well...

Why does Cyril speak of cleaning up
the city?

Is he not satisfied with what he already has?

I think he's just trying to frighten the Jews.

But why say it in front of you?

What if really he was addressing,

you and not them?

Me?

Why? I'm as much as Christian as he is.

Yes but you forget that many of us from,

your circle are not.

And a full sail, Prefect.

Let's go.

Aspasius, you ready?

Yes, mistress.

I would like you to take the sack
and climb to the top of the mast.

And now, Lady,

will you finally tell me
what the point of all this is?

When Aspasius drops the sack,

the boat will be moving forward.

Therefore, the sack won't fall at the foot
of the mast,

but will fall further back.

I would say...

about...

about here.

And what is so special about that?

Yes!
But you were wrong!

Yes!

Yes, but this is definite proof!

It's definitive. The sack...

The sack behaved
as if the boat was stationary.

What does, what does that mean?

I don't know.

But the same principle could
be applied to the Earth.

It could be moving around
the Sun without us realizing.

Aristarchus.

Exactly.

Why do you torment yourself with that, Lady?

Ptolemy's not perfect, but it works.

Orestes, but you are the one who...

A few years ago, you weren't so pragmatic,
Prefect.

Well, a few years ago,
I talked first and thought later.

I have Cepheus third.

Thirty-seven, forty-eight.

Venus and Mars share house in Aquarius.

My father would have celebrated
such a conjunction with a good wine.

The stars will not fall.
Oh really?

No, because they're fixed
to the lid of their chest.

The lid would open in two halves
and then Jesus will appear.

What chest are you talking about?

Don't you know that the
universe is a gigantic chest?

Heaven is the lid on top
and the Earth the ground.

They haven't told this fool
that the Earth is round.

The Earth is flat.

Your head is flat.

Read the Scriptures!

If the earth is round,

Why don't the people at the bottom fall off?

What about the ones on the sides?

Why don't they slide off?

Think about that.

Davus knows.

Hey, brother.

What do you say?

Is the Earth flat or round?

Only God knows those things.

Leave them on the ground!

Leave them!
Leave them on the ground!

That's where they belong.

Lady, you must not lose heart.

Today on the boat you made great progress.

Why. Why do the wanderers
bury their brightness?

So unexpectedly.

And what is worse.

Why. Why does the sun?

Why. Why does it change size
from summer to winter?

Perhaps because,

sometimes it is nearer,

and other times it is farther away.

But Aspasius,

Watch.

According to Aristarchus,

the sun must be at the center of everything.

With us the Earth,

traveling...

in a circle around it.

Therefore,

and this is the key.

Always at exactly...

the same...

distance.

Now, if as you just said, we accept the changes
in distance then we are forced to add...

and epicycle to the Earth's orbit.

So it's going to be nearer,

and then it's going to be farther away.

But now we fall into
the same trap as Ptolemy.

Circle upon circles.
Exactly!

So I just, I just do not know
how to resolve this conflict.

I mean, the only thing we could do is...

displace the sun from the center and...

well...

not to have a center.

It breaks my heart, Aspasius.

So tell me, what do I do?

Rest lady.

Parabalani!

Parabalani!
What is happening?

Parabalani, quick!
Help!

St. Alexander's on fire!

It's a fire.

Come on!

Get water! Get the bucket!

Quick! Other there.

Hurry!

Quick!

Come on, come on!

Parabalani!

Parabalani!

Parabalani, quick!

Where's the fire?

Where's the fire?

Jews!
It's a trap.

It's a trap!

Christians, all.

Last night was a night to deplore.

Now I say to you.

Grieve no longer for our dead brothers.

Weep not.

Shed your tears for the others,

for they are executioners.

Yes!

Yes! Weep for them or those
who have done this,

know not of God,

nor of love nor of parity.

They know not,

because it is they...

who repeat the words of the Scriptures
with no understanding at all.

It is they who saw only a man,

when the Son of God was
standing in front of them.

And it is they who in their blindness
mocked him,

and crucified him.

Yes.

Weep! Weep!

Weep for the Jews those evil butchers
of our Lord.

Because God,

because God, God, God
has already condemned them.

It is God's will, that they live as slaves,

cursed and exiled until the end of time.

Cursed and exiled!

Cursed and exiled!

Cursed and exiled!

Lady, do not stop, Lady.

Now all the Jews will want to retaliate.

I'm afraid you don't understand
what's really happening.

When this is all over, there will
be no more Jews in Alexandria.

I'm sorry for busting in like this.

Lady, you should not
have risked coming here.

Where are the troops?

Why are there no more soldiers
on the streets?

No army could contain that mob.
The entire city is in a frenzy.

He's calling for the annihilation
of women and children.

A bishop!

A Christian!
Then lock him up.

Prefect.

You should have him arrested.

It's not so easy.

Lady,

Cyril knows they both share the same faith.

That places our Prefect in a very...

awkward position.

If he defends the Jews,

half the city will rise up
against his government.

I see.

If you choose to do nothing though,

I believe Cyril will...

continue to do the same thing
over and over again and until...

until there is no one left in this city.

No people for this government to govern.

How naive of me...

How naive of me to think
we have finally changed.

Jews out!

First they kill them,

then they bury them.

The Bishop of Cyrene.

What is he doing here?

I'll find out.

It's my little library of Alexandria.

This is where I teach the children.

An Apollonian cone.

Yes, I built it to teach them
about the four curves.

The Circle.

The ellipse.

Orestes should really be here by now.

Parabola.

And hyperbola.

It's truly beautiful.

You know, I often look at it
and I always wonder...

why does the circle co-exist with such
impure shapes?

What I'd give to sit here
and listen to you again.

I bore you.

It's been a long time since
I've done anything but,

beat my head against a stone.

Anyhow, there are more
important matters at hand.

Forgive me.

Two Christians in the hands of a heathen.

It's an outrage!

It's an outrage!

How many left?
I don't know but it smells.

Ammonius.

Does God speak with you?

All the time.

Ammonius this, Ammonius that.

Ammonius, Ammonius, Ammonius.

Today, he spoke to me,

so quickly I had to ask him slow down.

Tell me something.

Do you ever think we're mistaken?

Why?

I was forgiven...

but now I can't forgive.

Forgive?

Who?

The Jews?

Well, Jesus pardon them on the cross.

Jesus was God...

and only He can show such clemency.

How dare you compare yourself to God?

Brother.

We are still alive.

Why?

Because it was his will to save us
from the stones.

God wants us here doing what we do.

Don't you believe in that anymore?

My Lord...

Cyril is a very proud man.

He'll agree to meet,
but he wouldn't discuss the Jews,

only discuss peace.

Peace?

My suggestion,

as your humble adviser in this affair,

is for you to accept.

Let peace be foremost.

Lady, what do you think?

Well I...

I don't think it's very encouraging.

Why would he want to come
and see Orestes

without any concrete proposals?

And there's something else.

He won't come to you.

Demands he meet you in the Library,

during the Sunday service.

In the Library?

Why?

Only Christians are being permitted
to enter the Library since it was stoned.

It is a provocation!

Allow me to suggest.

If you consider your presence so essential,

why not let yourself be baptized?

The majority of us here,

beginning with our Prefect,

have accepted Christ.

Why not the rest of you?

It's only a matter of time and you know it!

Really?

It is just a matter of time?

Well,

excuse me, honored member
but as far as I'm aware.

Your God has not yet proved himself
to be more just,

or more merciful than his predecessors.

Lady.

Is it really just a question
of time before I accept your faith?

Why then,

should this assembly,

accept the counsel of someone
who admittedly,

believes in absolutely nothing?

I believe in philosophy.

Philosophy.

Just what we need,

in times like this.

Enough!

All these years, I've been studying.

With absolutely no life of my own.

And I wonder...

what was the point?

Forget about what was said today.

Is this all life holds for me?

What else?

I doubt anyone could see as a..

devoted wife and mother.

I think...

I think everyone in the city
knows the story of the handkerchief.

So...

My father loved a woman.

Even he.

Who have I ever loved?

Except you Libanius.

If I could just...

just unravel this,

just a little bit more.

And just get a little close to the answer then,

then I would...

then I would go to my grave
a happy woman.

Why?

Why does that mean so much to you?

Right now..

This very second the whole Earth
could be moving,

and no one realizes it.

Except you and me.

Believe me Lady,
it's best no one does.

Do you...
Do you really not think it important?

I don't understand why you insist
on moving the ground we walk on.

Well, you saw for yourself
what happened on the boat.

Yes, I did. But that does not
necessarily mean the Earth moves.

What if it does?

Hypatia, look around you.

Death,

horror,

destruction.

If the stars move in a circle,

why would they share
their perfection with us?

So we do not move.

In a circle.

We don't move.

Circle.

We do not move in a circle.

Ever since Plato,

all of them: Aristarchus,
Hipparchus, Ptolemy,

they have all, all, all tried to reconcile
their observations with circular orbits but,

what if another shape is hiding in
the heavens?

Another shape?

Lady, there is no shape purer than the circle.

You taught us that.

I know, I know but suppose,
just suppose the,

the purity of the circle has,

has blinded us from seeing
anything beyond it.

The same way that the glare of the sun
blind us from actually seeing the stars.

I must begin all over with,

with new eyes I must...

I must rethink everything.
I have to rethink everything.

Reading from the first letter
of Paul to Timothy.

I desire therefore,

that everywhere,

men should lift up holy hands in prayer,

without anger or disputing.

In like manner,

I desire women,

to dress modestly,

with decency and propriety,
not with braided hair,

or gold or pearls or...

expensive clothes,

but with good deeds.
Why is he reading this passage?

I don't know, Prefect.

I assure you it is not the one we agreed on.

That a woman learn in quietness
and in full submission.

I do not permit a woman to teach
or to have authority over a man...

but to be...

in silence.

This is the word of God!

Amen.

Amen.

Jesus himself,

knew this when he entrusted
his holy legacy to twelve men.

Men.

Not a woman among them.

And yet,

I know of some in Alexandria,

who admire and even
trust in the word of a woman.

The philosopher Hypatia.

A woman who declared,

in public, her ungodliness.

A witch!

Dignitaries,

it is time for you all to reconcile yourselves,

with Christ.

This is the word of God.

Kneel before it and embrace its truth.

Kneel.

Is he not going to kneel?

Is he not going to kneel?

Kneel!

Kneel!

Sinner!

I am a Christian!

I am a Christian!
You're not a Christian!

I'm as Christian as you are.

Make way for the Prefect!

Make way!

I am a baptized Christian!

I am a baptized Christian!

I'll kill you.

I am as Christian as you.

I am as Christian as you are.

I mean, how could such a thing be possible?

The culprit has been executed.

I would like you to take me
to the Prefect immediately.

Lady, he himself gave the order

for you to be confined to
the house until further notice.

At the moment your presence
on the streets is not advisable.

For what reason?

Cyril has made some serious
accusations against you.

And..

What does he accuse me of?

Ungodliness.

And witchcraft.

I see.

Is something bothering you, Lady?

No.

Why don't you tell me what's worrying you?

Prefect, why don't you bite on it?

Speak.

Prefect, the Bishop of Cyrene
wishes to see you.

Leaves, all of you.

Prefect, the wound is not yet closed.
No.

Get out. Get out!

All of you, out! Out!

Well, that went well.

You think I had a part on this?

Would I show my face here
if I wanted to betray you?

Are you blind?
I was, yes, I was. I was blind.

I was blind.

Well, it's my head.

He's wanted all along it's me,

that snake is after.

This...

government!

This city!

Now listen.

War is brewing.
I know.

I know.

Then swear your loyalty to me.

To the Empire. Do it.

Condemn him or get out.

I will do it.

On my knees, if necessary.

And not only that.

In a few days, I can gather
other bishops from the province

and amongst from the desert
all against Cyril.

First, I must ask you a question.

Orestes do you believe in Jesus?

Do I what?

Do you believe in Jesus?
Do I what?

Are you a true Christian?

Or did you like,

so many others, only convert
to prosper in politics?

Synesius.

Why didn't you kneel?

What choice did I have?
Why didn't you kneel?

What choice did I have?

Betray Hypatia?

Condemn her?

Would you have done that?

I would never offend God.

It's he, he is offending God.

He is offending him.

He's twisting,

twisting His words,
he's using the Scriptures.

He read,

what is written.

How many women do you obey?

How many?

How many do you admire and listen to?

Only one.

Only one.

The Scripture,

The Scripture is correct...

and it was in His hands.

Brother, don't you see?

Don't you see the insult to God?

In front of everyone.

I don't know...

I don't know what, what I believe.

You have to tell him.

Go tell him now, Orestes.
Tell him you believe in what is written.

I believe...
Don't tell me. Tell Him.

Tell God.

Kneel!

Kneel!

Many are those who remember today the miracles
our beloved brother performed in life.

Like the time he commended
himself to the Father

and threw himself into fire
and was not even singed.

Ammonius,

dead of bravely defending your faith in Christ.

I proclaim you a martyr.

A saint.

From now on, you shall be known as...

Saint Thomasius.

We want justice!

Justice!

May God show us the way,

my dear Parabalani.
Little else can I say to you.

What about the monks of Nitria?

We can win at least 500 of them,
plus 500 of our own men.

Do you think that's enough?

He's the Prefect.

He has a whole army to protect him.

Listen!

Why don't we do something
much more simple and effective?

What are you talking about?

We can hurt him where it hurts most.

How?

That whore.
Who?

What if we dared to look
at the world just as it is?

Let us shed for a moment
every preconceived idea.

What shape would it show us?
What shape?

You once said that the problem lies
in the inconsistency of the sun.

Yes. Yes I did, good, good.
Put it into words.

The sun must be at the center,
since we revolve around it.

And at the same time,

in another position
since our distance from it varies.

Yes, exactly.
How?

How could it occupy...

two positions, at once?

How could I occupy two positions at once?

How could I occupy two positions at once?

How could I occupy two positions at once?

Aspasius..

Yes, yes. There.
And then the other one here.

Keeping the same proportion.

Good. Very good.
Now, tie this end to that torch.

Aspasius.

I want you to imagine
that this is the Earth.

And that each of these flames,

represent the two extreme
positions of the sun in relation to it,

in winter and in summer.

What would happen if, if both these
positions with the two centers...

of one and the same circle?

But it is impossible, mistress.

Wait. What do we know about a circle?
We know that the center of a circle,

is always the same distance
from any point along its perimeter.

Exactly.
Yes so,

what if I divide the center into two,

but what I keep constant is the sum
of their two distances to the perimeter.

Alright, look. I'll show you.
Watch.

As I move this rod along the cord,
as one segment increases,

the other segment decreases,
and vice versa.

Therefore the sum of the two
is always going to be constant.

Do you see that?

Now what if,

we apply this, to the movement of the Earth?

What...

figure...

will be obtained?

An ellipse!

With the sun at one of its foci.

Because,

what is a circle,

except a very special ellipse.

Whose foci have joined so close
together that they appear to be one.

Perhaps I'm completely raving,

Aspasius I mean,

I mean why should this be so?
Maybe I'm just...

Maybe...

What do you think?

It could well be solved, mistress.

Alright, well, we'll continue
with this tomorrow.

Get some sleep.

Good night, mistress.
Good night.

Thank you.

Davus!

Davus!

What are you doing?

Lady.

Let me see.

Why don't you sit down?

Where is everybody?

Please sit down.

I have...

I have news for you too.

All dignitaries,

who have yet to embrace the Christian faith,

are to be baptized,

in public.

The aim is very clear.

It's to add to our cause,

all the Christians in the city,

decent folk,

better,

to fight for me.

You speak of peddling faith.

Very well.

Since everything seems
to have been decided already.

I don't understand why you
required my presence here.

I am not a member of government.

No, you are more than that.

You are the person I trust most,
and everyone knows it.

You cannot be saying what you are saying.

Lady.

Many years ago,

years ago you taught us something.

If...

If two...

are equal to a third,

they are all are equal to each other.
Do you remember?

Yes.

The three of us,
we are all good people.

And you, you are  as Christian as we are!

Synesius, you don't question
what you believe.

You cannot.

I must.

Well...

That's a pity,

Lady.

A great pity.

Our revered teacher taken away
from what she herself taught us.

Or do you think I'm not aware
of the insane things you invoke...

Synesius!
with Earth moving around the Sun.

What next, Lady, what next?

I beg of you, you must let me go.

Let me in! Let me in!

I'll go straight to her. I just wanna talk!
Why does she wanna see a Parabalani?

Lady! Lady!
Go away, before we arrest you.

Leave!
Aspasius!

It's me, Davus.

Get off me.

Tell them who I am.
Do you know this man?

Yes.
What do you want?

I need to speak to her.

I need to speak with the mistress,
where is she?

My mistress is not here.
It's urgent, where is she?

She's at the Prefect's palace.

Where?

The Prefect palace!
Prefect's palace, thank you.

Get out! Get out of here.

Who was that?

He was a slave once.

Wait, please, wait!

I beg you!

If you... If you don't agree,

I won't be able to protect you any longer.

I won't be able to have dealings with you,

neither greet you.

Hypatia.

Don't you see?

I can't go on without you.

I cannot.

Without you, I can't defeat Cyril.

Orestes.

Cyril has already won.

Thank you.

I do not need you.

Davus!

Brother!

Where are you going?

We found her!

Come on, walk!

Move it, sinner!

Whore!

Witch!

Pagan sinner!

Move!
Come on!

Witch!

Strip her naked!

Get up.

That's it.

So that God can behold
in all your filth, whore.

The way you knock the Prefect so hard.

Heathen!

Whore.

Look,

she's not reacting.

She will scream all right,

when we skin her alive.

How many of you have knives?
None.

Don't stain your hands with impure blood.

Let's stone her!

Let's stone this witch!

Get some stones.

Quickly!
The ones we throw at Orestes.

They are still here.

I'll stay with her.

She fainted.

The body of Hypatia was mutilated and the remains
were dragged through the streets and burned.

Orestes was outlawed forever and Cyril
took control of the power in Alexandria.

Later, Cyril was declared a Saint
and Doctor of the Church.

Although not any of Hypatia works remain,

it is known that she was an
exceptional astronomer,

well-known for the mathematical
study of conical curves.

1200 years later, in the 17th century,
astronomer Johannes Kepler

described that one of those curves,
the ellipse,

governs the movement of the planets.
