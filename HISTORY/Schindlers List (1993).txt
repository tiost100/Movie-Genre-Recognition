And it was evening and it was
morning, the sixth day...

And the heavens and the earth and
all their hosts were completed

And God finished by
the seventh day...

"His" work which "He" had done,

and "He" rested on the
seventh day from all...

"His" work which "He" had done

And God blessed the seventh
day and sanctified it.

Lord our God, King
of the universe,

who has sanctified us with His
commandments has desired us

and has given us, in
love and good will,

His holy Shabbat as a heritage,

in remembrance of the
work of Creation;

For You have chosen
us and sanctified us

from among all the
nations, and with love

and good will given us Your
holy Shabbat as a heritage.

Blessed are You Lord, who
sanctifies the Shabbat

Let's get together, please.

Smile. Good.

Yes, sir.

Bring them over a round of drinks.

Very good, sir. And who
shall I say they are from?

You can say they are from me.

- From the gentleman.
- Where?

Do you know him?

- Find out who he is.
- Yes, sir.

Agnieszka, I would give anything
to hear you sing tonight...

but I know you won't.

You embarrass me.

What's he doing?

Stay here.

How are you doing?

You'd leave a woman alone at the
table in a place like this?

Sweetheart, you're the
picture of loneliness.

What a lovely fragrance.
You are breaking my heart.

An extra chair, please.
Vodka for my friend.

- And for the lady?
- Pernod.

"There's a wood sale
in Green Forest..."

"a wood sale."

"Wood is being sold
in the Green Forest."

Come to the table,
girls. Drink with us.

"Left around the corner,
right around the corner..."

"there is wood sale everywhere."

Come to us. Merry us.

"The whole trunk costs only
one taler. One taler."

"The whole trunk costs only
one taler, one taler."

Thank you.

I'll tell you what I
mean by cooperative.

Two days after the
law is passed that

all Jews have to wear the star...

the Jewish tailors
are turning them

out by the gross in a variety...

of fabrics at three zloty each.

Tell me about your cellar wines.

I have an excellent
German Riesling, 1937.

French.

A Bordeaux. Chateau
Latour, '28, '29?

No, I'm sorry.

It's as if they have no idea
what kind of law it is.

As if it's the emblem
of a riding club.

- A Margaux, '29?
- No, no, we don't have that.

Burgundy then? A
Romanee-Conti, '37?

Yes.

It's human nature. "We'll
do this to avoid that."

That's what they have done
since thousands of years.

It's what they do. They
weather the storm.

But this storm is
different. This is

not the Romans. This
storm is the SS.

"If God wants to honour you..."

"then he'll send you world wide."

"If god wants to honour you then
he'll send you world wide."

"Faleri, Falera..."

"Faleri Falera-ha ha ha."

"Faleri, Falera."

"He sends you away world wide"

- Martin?
- Yes, sir.

Who is that man?

That's Oskar Schindler.

"Faleri, Falera ha ha ha."

"He sends you away world wide."

"Faleri, Falera."

"He sends you away world wide."

To Krakow.

(SINGING SONG IN GERMAN)

(SINGING CONTINUES)

Attention, all Jews.

From now on, Jewish art...

meat preparing is forbidden.

Announcement for all
Jews. From now on...

Rabbi...

Private property
cannot be confiscated.

How long are the schools
going to be closed?

I do not know the answer.

Article 47: Pillage is
formally prohibited.

You don't know anything.

I am familiar with the
Hague Convention.

Religious...

They come into our house and tell
us we don't live there any more.

It now belongs to a
certain SS officer.

Please. I only know
what they tell me.

And what they tell me
changes from day to day.

Aren't you supposed
to be able to help?

I mean, what if I just
took this thing off?

What are they going
to do about it?

They will shoot you.

Why don't you stop
this silly talk?

Itzhak Stern.

I'm looking for Itzhak Stern.

Are you Itzhak Stern or not?

- I am.
- Where can we talk?

There's a company you did the
books for, on Lipowa Street.

Made what? Pots and pans?

By law, I have to tell
you, sir, I'm a Jew.

Well, I'm a German.
So there we are.

- A good company, you think?
- Modestly successful.

I know nothing about
enamelware. Do you?

I was just the accountant.

Simple engineering though,
wouldn't you think?

Change the machines around,
whatever you do...

you could make other
things, couldn't you?

Field kits, mess kits.
Army contracts.

Once the war ends, forget
it, but for now it's great.

You can make a fortune,
don't you think?

I think most people right
now have other priorities.

Like what?

I'm sure you'll do just fine,
once you get the contracts.

In fact, the worse things
get, the better you'll do.

Oh, well, I can get the signatures
I need. That's the easy part.

Finding the money to buy
the company, that's hard.

You don't have any money?

Not that kind of money.
You know anybody?

Jews, yeah.

Investors. You must
have contacts...

in the Jewish business
community working here.

What community? Jews can
no longer own businesses.

That's why this one's
in receivership.

But they wouldn't own it.

I'd own it. I'd pay them back
in product-pots and pans.

- Pots and pans.
- Something they can use.

Something they can
feel in their hands.

They can trade it on the black
market, do whatever they want.

Everybody's happy.

If you want, you could
run the company for me.

Let me understand.

They'd put up all the
money, I'd do all the work.

What, if you don't mind
my asking, would you do?

I'd make sure it's known
the company's in business.

I'd see that it had
a certain panache.

That's what I'm good at. Not
the work, not the work.

The presentation.

I'm sure I don't know anybody
who'll be interested in this.

Well, they should
be, Itzhak Stern.

Tell them they should be.

Attention, attention.

All Jews. From now on,
it's forbidden...

I've got a client who'll sell
marks for zloty at 2.45 to 1.

Wool, mink collar.
It's a nice coat.

She'll trade it for
ration coupons.

- Wicks, for lamps.
- You have a truckload of wicks?

What am I going to do with
a truckload of wicks?

9 by 12, 9 by 14.

I don't know. Big,
beautiful, Persian.

- What?
- You don't recognise this?

- It's shoe polish.
- In metal containers?

You asked for shoe polish.

In metal containers. This is
glass, it's not what I asked for.

What's the difference?

- What's the difference?
- What's the difference?

My client sold it to his client,
who sold it to the German Army.

Only by the time it
got there, because...

of the freezing cold, it
broke. All 10,000 units.

This is not my problem.

- This is not his problem.
- This is not your problem?

- This is not my problem.
- All right.

The German Army wants to
find out where it came from.

I am going to make
sure they find out.

Now it's your problem.

You be quiet.

Metal containers.

Hello.

Pardon me for interfering,
but that's a nice shirt.

Nice shirt.

Do you know where I can find
a nice shirt like that?

Like this?

It's illegal to buy or sell
anything on the street.

We don't do that.
We're here to pray.

Do you have any idea how much
a shirt like this costs?

Nice things cost money.

How many?

I'm going to need some other
things, too, as things come up.

- This won't be a problem.
- From time to time.

Attention. Attention.

- Name? Address?
- Fill in the forms.

Go on, go on. Don't
push each other.

- You come here.
- Stay there.

Attention. Attention. All
Jews are enforced...

to live in the Jewish district.

Not getting the residence
from the registry office...

will be against decree 44/91 and
judged through the military court.

This is obviously the right
place. How are you doing?

Goodbye, Jews. Goodbye, Jews.

Goodbye, Jews. Goodbye, Jews.

Goodbye, Jews.

Goodbye, Jews. Goodbye, Jews.

(WOMAN SINGING LULLABY IN POLISH)

Oh, my God.

Oy, God. Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

It could not be better.

- It could be worse.
- How? Tell me.

How on earth could it
possibly be worse?

Good morning.

(SPEAKING GERMAN)

- Hey, Goldberg.
- Poldek.

What's this?

The Jewish assembly has
its own police now.

- You don't say.
- Coordination service.

I'm a policeman now, could you
believe it? It's hard to believe.

Oh, no, it's not hard to believe.

It's a good racket, Poldek.
The only racket here.

Look, maybe I could put in a good
word for you with my superiors.

Your superiors?

Come on, they're not as
bad as everyone says.

Well, they're worse than everyone
says, but it's a lot of money.

A lot of money.

Give me my housing assignment.

Come on.

You look funny in
that hat, Goldberg.

You look like a clown, you know?

He's a very important man.

Just give him two
minutes of your time.

Since when did time cost money?
Just sit down and listen...

please. Sir?

For each thousand you invest,
I will repay you with...

Two hundred.

200 kilos of enamelware a month...

to begin in July and to
continue for one year.

After which time, we're even.
That's it. It's very simple.

- Not good enough.
- It's not good enough.

Not good enough?

Look where you're
living. Look where

you've been put.
"Not good enough."

A couple of months ago you'd
be right, not any more.

Money's still money.

No, it is not. That's
why we are here.

Trade goods...

that's the only currency that'll
be worth anything in the ghetto.

Things have changed, my friend.

Did I call this meeting?

You told Mr Stern you
wanted to speak to me.

I'm here. I've made
you a fair offer.

Fair would be a percentage
in the company.

Forget the whole thing. Get out.

How do we know that you
will do what you say?

Because I said I would.

You want a contract? To
be upheld by what court?

I said what I'll do.
That's our contract.

(CONVERSING IN POLISH)

Five, six, seven...

eight, nine...

The standard SS rate
for Jewish skilled

labourers is seven marks a day...

five for unskilled and women.

This is what you pay the
Reich Economic Office.

The Jews themselves
receive nothing.

Poles you pay wages. Generally,
they get a little more.

- Are you listening?
- What was that about the SS?

The rate? The what?

The Jewish worker's salary...

you pay it directly to the
SS, not to the worker.

- He gets nothing.
- But it's less.

It's less than what
I would pay a Pole.

It's less?

That's the point I'm
trying to make.

Poles cost more.

Why should I hire Poles?

An enamelware factory,
over at, Lipowa Street.

It, it, It's owned by a German.

But it's outside the ghetto, so
you can barter for extra goods...

for eggs, I don't
know what you need...

with the Polish workers.
You can't get it here.

Also, he's asking for ten
healthy women for the...

I'm healthy.

Bring your sister, okay?

(SHOUTING ORDERS IN
GERMAN AND POLISH)

You need to convince
them you have a trade...

something valuable
to the war effort.

Like what?

- I'm a musician.
- What if you don't?

Your name goes on a list.

Your name is on the list,
they put you on trucks...

- No, no, no, that's not true.
- You're a musician?

Yeah.

I'd find a good hiding
place if I were you.

I'm not going to hide
like some animal.

There are places to hide.

The next.

I'm a graduate of the
University of Lwow.

I used to work at the
hydroelectric station in Roznow...

Blue card.

I'm gonna get the necessary papers

because this card is
no good any more.

You can stay in this line all day,
you'll still get one of these.

They are no good. You'll have
to leave the line now...

then you'll get a blue
card, a Blauschein,

to say that you are
an essential worker.

I'll get these papers
for you at Pankiewicz.

Pharmacist. Just there, look.

Guess who is here?

Poldek. Enjoying the
weather, Poldek?

- Enjoying the lines?
- Need some shoe polish?

In metal container maybe.

Not essential? I think you

misunderstand the
meaning of the word.

No blue card, sir.
Stand over there.

Move. Next.

What do you mean, "Not essential"?

I teach history and literature.
Since when it's not essential?

He's metal polisher.

It was not right?

It's very good. He's 53 years old.

- It's too new.
- Thank you.

You're crazy. You left
it in your drawer.

How many times have I told you?

Your work certificate, you keep
in your pocket at all times.

And you leave everything
in your drawer.

How many times I've told you?

I'm a metal polisher.

Take the round sheet of tin...

dip it in soap emulsion.

Then place it centrally
in the press.

We obtain the soup
pot. The soup pot.

Soup pot.

Grosz, Mrs Grosz, stay together.

Look, sir, I have ten work permits

here for the German
enamel factory...

and signed by Mr
Bankier and myself.

If it's carbonised,
clean it with a file.

But don't touch both the
electrodes at the same time.

You'll get electrocuted.
Here, have a try.

Roll the metal under the press...

but be very careful unless
you want your fingers...

to become part of the teapot.

- Occupation?
- I'm a writer. I play the flute.

But Moses is a
skilled metalworker.

He can make tin pots.
He can make tanks.

He can make whatever
Mr Schindler asks.

He's highly skilled.
Give him your card.

Moses, give him your card.

Now, dip the basin with the
tongs into the enamel solution.

And after swivelling it around,

carefully place it
aside to drip-dry.

And whatever he asks
you, allow me just

to represent you
and speak for you.

Don't say a word.

Filing, billing, keeping track
of my appointments, shorthand.

Typing, obviously.
How is your typing?

All right.

Please.

You need a secretary. Pick one.

I don't know how. They're
all so... qualified.

You have to choose.

Big smile, big smile.

If you would, look after my guest.

Boxed teas are good.
Coffee, pâté...

kielbasa sausage,
cheeses, Beluga caviar...

and, of course, who could live
without German cigarettes?

Get me as many as you can find.

And some more fresh fruit.

The real rarities, oranges,
lemons, pineapples.

I need several boxes of
Cuban cigars. The best.

And dark unsweetened chocolate...

not in the shape of ladyfingers,
the chunk chocolate.

Big as my hand, you
sample at wine tastings.

We're going to need lots of
cognac. The best, Hennessy.

Dom Perignon champagne.
Get L'espadon sardines...

and, oh, try to find
nylon stockings.

It is my distinct
pleasure to announce...

the fully operational status
of German enamel factory...

manufacturers of superior
enamelware crockery...

expressly designed and
crafted for military use.

Utilising only the most
modern equipment...

D.E.F.'s staff of
highly skilled and

experienced artisans
and journeymen...

deliver a product of
unparalleled quality...

enabling me to proffer, with
absolute confidence and pride...

a full line of field
and kitchenware...

unsurpassable in all
respects by my competitors.

See attached list and
available colours.

Anticipating the enclosed bids
will meet with your approval...

looking forward to a long and
mutually prosperous association...

I extend to you in advance
my sincerest gratitude...

and very best regards.
Oskar Schindler.

Yeah, I need 700 gross from
here for next Thursday.

Nine hundred, no, make
it ten for Wednesday.

All this stuff here
goes to Madritsch's

factory on Tuesday of next week.

My father was fond of saying, "You
need three things in life..."

"a good doctor, a
forgiving priest..."

"and a clever accountant."

The first two, I've
never had much use for.

But the third.

Just pretend, for Christ's sake.

Is that all?

I'm trying to thank you.

I'm saying I couldn't have
done this without you.

The usual thing would be to
acknowledge my gratitude.

It would also, by the way,
be the courteous thing.

You're welcome.

Get out of here.

Klonowska, who is it?

She's so embarrassed. Look at her.

You know something?
You would like her.

- Oskar, please.
- What?

I don't have to like her...
just because you do.

It doesn't work that way.

You've done well here.

You look wonderful.

- Be careful of the step, miss.
- Mrs Schindler, Marek.

It's not a charade, all this?

Charade? How could
it be a charade?

The clothes, the
car, the apartment.

Wait a minute.

Take a guess how many
people are on my payroll.

Oskar.

My father, at the height of his
success, had 50. I've got 350.

350 workers on the factory
floor, with one purpose.

To make pots and pans?

To make money. For me.

Does anyone ask about me?

Back home? Everybody.
All the time.

They won't soon forget the name

Schindler here, I
can tell you that.

"Oskar Schindler" they'll say.

"Everybody remembers him."

"He did something extraordinary."

"He did something
no one else did."

"He came here with
nothing, a suitcase...

"and built a bankrupt company
into a major manufactory."

"And left with a steamer trunk..."

"two steamer trunks
full of money."

"All the riches of the world."

It's comforting to see
that nothing's changed.

You're wrong, Emilie.

There's no way I could have
known this before but...

there was always
something missing.

In every business I tried, I can
see now, it wasn't me that failed.

Something was missing.

Even if I'd known
what it was, there's

nothing I could have
done about it...

because you can't
create this thing.

And it makes all the
difference in the

world between success and failure.

Luck?

War.

Should I stay?

It's a beautiful city.

I asked you if I should stay.

It's up to you.

Promise me, Oskar. No doorman or
maitre d' will ever presume...

I'm anyone other than Mrs
Schindler, and I'll stay.

Goodbye, darling.

I could try to read
this or I could

eat my lunch while it's still hot.

We're doing well?

- Yes.
- Better this month than last?

Yes.

Any reason to think next
month will be worse?

The war could end.

- What?
- There is a machinist outside...

who'd like to thank you
personally for giving him a job.

Every day he comes. He's very

grateful. It'll
just take a minute.

Mr Lowenstein.

I want to thank you, sir...

for giving me the
opportunity to work.

You're welcome. I'm sure
you're doing a great job.

The SS beat me up. They
would have killed me...

but I am essential to the
war effort, thanks to you.

That's great.

I work hard for you.

I'm sure you do.

I'll continue to
work hard for you.

That's great. Thanks.

- God bless you, sir.
- All right.

You are a good man.

- He saved my life.
- Yes, he did.

- God bless him.
- Yeah. Come on.

God bless you.

I'm sorry, Herr Direktor, but
you're running very late.

This is for the major, sir.

And this is for his niece,
Greta. It's her birthday.

- Greta as in Garbo.
- Don't ever do that to me again.

Go. Go, go, drive. Don't bow.

Did you notice that
man had one arm?

Did he?

- What's his use?
- Very useful.

- How?
- Very useful. Success.

You'll be given
brooms and shovels...

each of you will grab one and
start cleaning the street.

We'll be late for work.

You shouldn't think of
them as yours, Oskar.

You need to understand that
some of the officers here...

don't give a damn
about production.

To them, it's a matter
of, national priority...

that Jews be made to shovel snow.

It's got nothing to do
with reality, Oskar.

You know it and I know it.

Jews shovelling snow.

It's got a, ritual significance.

- Come with me.
- I am an essential worker.

- Essential worker?
- Yes.

I work for Oskar Schindler.

Essential worker for
Oskar Schindler.

A one-armed Jew? Twice as useless.

Yes, yes.

I lost a day of production, Rolf.

I work for Oskar Schindler.

Danka, look at the snow. Look
at the snow. Look at the snow.

I lost a worker. I expect
to be compensated.

File a grievance with the
Economic Office. It's your right.

- Would it do any good?
- Of course not.

A big shot from the SS Budget and

Construction Office
came to lunch...

and he told us that to believe the

Jewish skilled worker
had a place...

in Reich economics was
a treasonable idea.

A one-armed machinist, Oskar?

He was a metal press operator.

Quite skilled.

Mr Director.

Shit. I don't believe it.

Stern, is that you?

No, it's Poldek. It's about Stern.

Leave your luggage
on the platform.

Clearly label it.

Given name first,
then your surname.

Do not bring your
baggage with you.

It will follow you later.

Leave your luggage
on the platform.

Clearly label it.

Leave your luggage
on the platform.

Stern?

- He's on the list.
- He is?

- Well, let's find him.
- I'm sorry. You can't have him.

He's on the list. If
he were an essential

worker, he would not
be on the list.

I'm talking to a clerk.
What is your name?

- Sir, the list is correct.
- I didn't ask you about the list.

- I asked you your name.
- Klaus Tauber.

Tauber.

Squad leader, this gentleman
thinks a mistake's been made.

My plant manager is
somewhere on this train.

If it leaves with him on it,
it'll disrupt production...

and the Armaments Board
will want to know why.

Attention. The train
is about to leave.

Is he on the list?

Yes, sir. Itzhak Stern.

Well, the list is correct, sir.
There is nothing I can do.

- What is your name?
- Close and secure all doors.

- My name? My name is Kunder.
- This train is now leaving.

- Kunder.
- Hauptscharführer Kunder.

- K-U-N-D-E-R.
- And what's yours?

Schindler. S-C-H-I-N-D-L-E-R.

Gentlemen, thank you very much.

I think I can guarantee
you you'll both be in...

Southern Russia before the
end of the month. Good day.

Stern.

- Stern.
- Stern.

Itzhak Stern.

Stern. Itzhak Stern.

- Stern. Stern.
- Itzhak Stern.

- Stern.
- Sir.

- Stern.
- Herr Direktor.

My apologies.

- Stop the train. He's here.
- I apologise.

- Stop the train.
- Stop the train. Stop it.

Sign here. Initial there.

Makes no difference to us, you
understand. This one, that one.

It's the inconvenience
to the list.

It's the paperwork.

I somehow left my
work card at home.

I tried to explain them
it was a mistake, but...

I'm sorry, it was stupid.

What if I got here
five minutes later?

Then where would I be?

I woke up from a
dream this morning.

I was broke and sharing a room
with 12 people I didn't know...

only to discover I was
broke and sharing

a room with 12 people
I didn't know.

- You laugh about it?
- I have to laugh.

You are living behind walls.

The walls I can deal with.

It's the restrictions to
my life I'm tired of.

Those walls keep them out.
That's all I care about.

I like it here. There's a
kind of, I don't know...

ancestral squalor to it all.

- You are a slave to these people.
- No one envies us any more.

- I'm smart.
- Oh, yes, you're smart.

- You're a real genius.
- You had your chance.

Today, today I actually found
time to organise a thought.

I can't remember the
last time I did that.

When's the last time we did this?

When's the last time we
stood around and talked?

No one ordered me
onto a truck today.

No one took my
business away from me.

You don't really have
a business to take.

There's nowhere down from here.

This is it. This is the bottom.

The ghetto is, liberty.

This street divides the
ghetto just about in half.

Right side, Ghetto A:
Civil employees...

industrial workers and so on.

Left side, Ghetto B:
Surplus labour...

the elderly and infirm mostly.

Which is where you'll
want to start, huh?

Do you have any questions, sir?

Ja, why is the top down?
I'm fucking freezing.

We expect a labour force
of 25.000 to 30.000.

Segregated of course. The men in
the barracks near the guarry...

the women on the other
side of the wire.

My place is where?

- There, sir.
- There?

- Yes, the villa.
- You call that a villa?

- Their synagogue, can you see it?
- That's not a villa.

We' to turn it into
the camp stables.

It's a house.

What's that over there?

Playground. Fifty-one.

And we have a dentist,
shoemaker, practical physicians.

There they are, sir.

One of you is, a very lucky girl.

There is an opening for a job...

away from all this,
backbreaking work...

at my new villa.

Which of you has
domestic experience?

Yeah, on second thought, I don't
really want someone else's maid.

All those annoying
habits I have to undo.

I don't want to give you my cold.

What's your name?

- Helen Hirsch.
- What?

Helen Hirsch.

- What? I can't hear.
- Helen Hirsch.

- Yes.
- Take it all down.

- Back to your work.
- To work.

Take it down. It is not safe.

She says the foundation was poured
wrong. She's got to take it down.

I told her it's the barracks,
not the fucking Hotel Europa.

Fucking Jew bitch engineer.
You fucking bitch.

Herr Kommandant. The
entire foundation...

has to be torn down and repoured.

If not, there will be at
least a subsidence...

at the southern end
of the barracks.

Subsidence, and then collapse.

- And you are an engineer?
- Yes.

My name is Diana Reiter.
I'm a graduate...

of Civil Engineering from
the University of Milan.

Ah, an educated Jew,
like Karl Marx himself.

- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

- Shoot her.
- What?

Commander. I'm only
trying to do my job.

Yeah, I'm doing mine.

Sir, she's foreman
of construction.

We are not going to have
arguments with these people.

Okay.

No. Shoot her here,
on my authority.

- It will take more than that.
- I'm sure, you are right.

Take it down, repour it,
rebuild it. Like she said.

We have more to see, but we have
only one more hour of light.

Today is history.

Today will be remembered.

Years from now, the young will
ask with wonder about this day.

Today is history, and
you are part of it.

Six hundred years ago...

when elsewhere they were putting
the blame for the Black Death...

Kazimierz The Great, so called...

told the Jews they
could come to Krakow.

- Chaja, bread.
- They came.

Not that fat. No, less.

They trundled their
belongings into the city.

- Yes, a bit less.
- They settled...

they took hold. They prospered...

in business, science,
education, the arts.

They came here with nothing.

Nothing.

And they flourished.

For six centuries there
has been a Jewish Krakow.

Think about that.

By this evening...

those six centuries are a rumour.

They never happened.

Today is history.

Get off and line up in a two row.

Come on, quicker.

I think we will
start, with Ghetto B.

- All right?
- Start from both sides?

No, no. I would like
you to start there.

The right side?

- And then move around.
- All right.

Label them clearly. They
will follow you later on.

Leave your luggage.

Label them clearly.

They'll follow you later on.

- Open up.
- Lakoom.

(SOLDIERS SHOUTING IN GERMAN)

Come down.

Jews, all out.

Put on something
warm and come out.

To Chodi Square.

Gold, Chaim. Go to Chodi Square.

- Gold, Chaim.
- Yes, Chaim Gold.

Shoot him.

Put on something warm
and go to Chodi Square.

No baggage. No baggage.

- Go through.
- No baggage. No baggage.

Hey, little boy. How
old are you, huh?

Huh, what's your name?
What's your name, huh?

I said, no luggage.

Don't pack, no luggage.

Go to Chodi Square. Leave
your luggage here.

- Blue card.
- Chodi Square.

What's this bag doing here?

Everybody to Chodi Square.

We're getting out
through the sewers.

I have to check if they're clear.

Mila, pack some things.
Nothing bigger...

I can't go in the sewers.

I told you I won't
go in the sewers.

You can go. Yes, you can.

I won't go in the sewers.

- Move.
- Over there. Over there. Move.

Your card, Jew?

Your papers, Jew?

Your papers, Jew.

That line.

Your papers?

I'm not going up because
of your goddamn papers.

Your goddamn papers.

(WOMAN WAILING IN GERMAN)

Why are you shooting?
Are you crazy?

In this traffic, you
could have shot me.

The bullet passed me by so close.

- Sorry.
- Now you say sorry? You're crazy.

Stay away. Stay away.

Don't talk, don't talk.
Just go to the trucks.

Keep on walking, keep
on walking. Don't talk.

Come here, you fucking Jew.

Stand still. I said, stand still.

You can join her,

Women to the left.

Women to the left, and

Your government is in

Mama. Mama.

Mila.

Oh, God, Danka.

You have a blue card.

Blue card doesn't matter any more.

They are cleaning out the ghetto.

There's not enough room for you.

What are you talking
about? We tried it

before. There's more
than enough room.

- I changed my mind.
- Mama.

Look at the space in there. Now
look at me. You are just scared.

I can fit the girl, but not you.

- Mama, I'm coming out.
- Stay where you are.

I'd rather you be here
than who knows where.

Mama.

(SOLDIERS SHOUTING IN GERMAN)

Commander.

Very good saluting.

I respectfully report
I've been given

orders to clear the
bundles from the road.

So there will be no obstructions
to the thoroughfare.

Finish and join the lines,
little Polish clicking soldier.

Mrs Dresner?

Yes.

Oh, you are a friend of my son's.

Don't worry, I'll go
quietly. I'll be no trouble.

No, get under the
stairs. They'll be done

searching soon.
You'll be safe there.

- Please hide. Please.
- Warmed by the sun.

Hide under the stairs.

I've searched the building.
There's no one here.

Okay, then we're going
to the next block.

Understood.

- Danka.
- Mama.

Hello, Adam.

Hello, Danka.

Come with me. I will put
you in the good line.

Do you know the saying, "An
hour of life is still life"?

You are not a boy any more. I'm
saying a blessing for you.

Come here, come here.

Come on, come here.

Amon, you're such a
damned fucking child.

Wakey, wakey.

- Make coffee.
- Make it yourself.

The SS will manage certain
industries itself inside Plaszow.

A metalworks, brush factory...

another for reprocessing Jewish
clothing from the ghettos...

for use by bombed-out
families back home.

But it's private
industry like yours

that stands to benefit most...

by moving inside the wire of
Commandant Amon Goeth's camp...

No, no, no. Sit, sit.
Julian, how are you?

Good to see you, my friend.

- Oskar Schindler.
- Leo John.

Franz, good to see you.

Hello, Oskar. Glad
you could join us.

- My pleasure. Julius.
- How are you? You lost weight.

Only in the shoulders.
Please, everybody, sit down.

How are you doing?
Oskar Schindler.

- We started without you.
- Fine. I miss anything good?

I was explaining to Herr
Bosch and Herr Madritsch...

some of the benefits of moving
their factories into Plaszow.

I meant the food.

Since your labour
is housed on-site,

it's available to
you at all times.

You can work them all
night if you want.

Your factory policies,
whatever they've

been in the past,
they'll continue to be.

They'll be respected.

I have to know, where
do you get a suit

like that? What is
that? Is that silk?

Of course.

Yeah, it's, it has a
nice sheen about it.

- Thank you.
- Very nice.

I'd say I'd get you one, but the
man who made it is probably dead.

I don't know.

I go to work the other day.

Nobody's there.

Nobody tells me about this. I have
to find out. I have to go in.

Everybody's gone.

No.

No.

They're not gone. They're here.

They're mine. Every day that
goes by, I'm losing money.

Every worker that is shot costs me

money. I have to
find somebody else.

I have to trade them.

We are going to be
making so much money

that none of this
is going to matter.

It's bad business.

Thank you.

Leave the bottle.

Take that.

Lena, thank you.

Scherner told me something
else about you.

Yeah? What's that?

That you know the meaning
of the word "gratitude."

That it's not some vague
thing with you...

like it is with others.

You want to stay where you are.

You've got things
going on the side.

Things are good.

You don't want anybody
telling you what to do.

I can understand all that,
you know? I know you.

What you want... is
your own sub-camp.

Do you have any idea what is
involved? The paperwork alone?

You've got to build
the fucking thing.

Getting the fucking permits
is enough to drive you crazy.

Then the engineers show
up, they stand around...

they argue about
drainage, foundations...

codes, exact specifications,

fences 4 kilometres long, 1,200
kilograms of barbed wire...

6,000 kilograms of electrified
fences, ceramic insulators...

three cubic metres of
air space per prisoner.

I'm telling you, you want to shoot

somebody. I've been
through it. I know.

Well, you know. You've
been through it.

You could make things
easier for me.

I'd be grateful.

Clear the road.

Keep moving. Keep moving.

(SOLDIER SPEAKING IN POLISH)

- Keep moving.
- Turn left.

Where's Stern?

Goldberg and Chilowicz,
make sure I see my cut...

from the, factory
owners in this camp...

leaving you to take care
of my main account...

the Schindler account.

He wants his independence.
I gave it to him.

But independence costs money.

This you understand?

Look at me.

Don't forget who you
are working for now.

Yes.

- Make sure he stays.
- He's a slippery bastard.

Yes. Now, girls, everyone.

- We need more wine.
- More wine.

Stand on my friend.
Don't let him leave.

(TOASTING IN GERMAN)

- What happens in life...
- Cheers, cheers.

Thank you, Mr Director.

Cheers, Mr Director.

- What are you doing?
- What? Scratching my head.

Makes them think we
have lice. Helps

make them keep their distance.

- Do you have lice?
- Do you have your notebook?

The calendar on my
desk has the birthdays

of our SS friends'
wives and children.

Don't forget to send something.

Record pay-offs to the
Main Administration

and Economics Office,
the Armaments...

- Slowly, Stern, slowly.
- The Armaments Board...

Governor General's Division of the

Interior and Chief of
Police as "fees"...

and make them on the
first of each month...

as opposed to individual
pay-offs to our SS contacts.

The list is in the lower
drawer of my desk...

- which you...
- "First of month..."

SS contacts: List, lower drawer
of my desk, which you handle...

as cash contributions
to legitimate

charities sent to each
official's office.

Dealings with our black market
contacts, listed as suppliers...

in the legitimate ledger,
are more complicated.

Forget it.

What do you mean, you
can't forget it.

It gives me a headache.

- I couldn't get you out of here.
- I'll be all right.

Anyway, I'm here almost every
week. Wednesdays, usually.

I'll look in on you,
see how you're doing.

Here, put these in your pocket.

Come on.

Mr Director, don't let things
fall apart. I've worked too hard.

Thanks for... Good luck.

Attention. Caps off.

- Work.
- Back to work.

- What are you making?
- Hinges, sir.

Yeah, I've got some
workers coming in

tomorrow. Where are
they from again?

Yugoslavia, Mr Commander.

I've got to make room.

- Make me a hinge.
- Yes, sir.

Keep going, you're doing well.

Says he's doing well.

Oh, that's very good.

But I'm a bit confused, and
perhaps you can help me.

What I don't understand is
that you've been working...

since I think, what,
about 6.00 this morning?

Yet such a small pile of hinges.

- Oh, Christ.
- May I try that, sir?

Check the angle lever.
Maybe it's bent.

No, no. You wouldn't hear a click
if it was the angle lever.

- Maybe the pin shaft is greasy.
- Yeah, come on.

What did I just say? Here.

Mr Commander.

I beg to report that my heap of
hinges was so unsatisfactory...

because the machines were being
recalibrated this morning.

I was put on to shovelling coal.

Strange, huh?

Yeah.

Thank you, Muek.

Ah, Lisiek. Don't touch the
leather, it's just been oiled.

- Squad leader.
- Oh, for me?

Oh, thank you very
much, Mr Director.

Mr Director.

Mr Director.

Mr Director.

He was making hinges slowly.

So the man can turn
out a hinge in less

than a minute. Why the long story?

- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.

Nobody knows who
stole the chicken?

Tell him about the chicken.

A man walks around with a chicken
and nobody notices this.

Save yourselves.

Tell him about the chicken.

Still nobody knows?

It was you. You
committed this crime.

- No, sir.
- But you know who, though.

- Yes.
- Who?

Him.

- He's very gifted.
- Yeah, sure. Bring him over.

Sir, thank you.

- Thank you again, Mr Director.
- You're welcome again.

It's an honour to work for
such a great company.

It's great to have you.

I promise to learn
everything there's

to know about
enamelware production.

That's great.

- Hello? Miss Elsa Krause is here.
- I only need five minutes.

She wants to speak to Mr Director.

Yes.

He won't see you.

Please, sit down.

- Pernod? Cognac?
- No. No, thank you.

So, what can I do for you?

They say that no one dies here.

They say your factory is a haven.

They say you are good.

Who says that?

Everyone.

My name is Regina
Perlman, not Elsa Krause.

I've been living
in Krakow on false

papers since the ghetto massacre.

My parents are in Plaszow.

Their names are Chana
and Jakob Perlman.

They are older people. They are

killing older people
now in Plaszow.

They bury them up in
the forest. Look...

I don't have any money.

I borrowed these clothes.

I'm begging you.

Please, please bring them here.

I don't do that.

You've been misled.
I ask one thing:

Whether or not a worker
has certain skills.

My father is an importer,
not a metalworker.

Such activities are illegal.
You will not entrap me.

Cry, and I will have you
arrested. I swear to God.

People die. It's a fact of life.

He wants to kill everybody? Great.
What am I supposed to do about it?

Bring everybody over?
Is that what you think?

Send them over to
Schindler. Send them all.

His place is a haven, didn't
you know? It's not a factory.

It's not an enterprise
of any kind.

It's a haven for
rabbis and orphans...

and people with no
skills whatsoever.

You think I don't know
what you're doing?

You're so quiet all the
time. I know, I know.

- Are you losing money?
- That's not the point.

What other point is...

It's dangerous. It's
dangerous to me.

You have to understand. Goeth
is under enormous pressure.

You have to think of
it in his situation.

He's got this whole place to run.

He's responsible for everything
here, all these people.

He's got a lot of
things to worry about.

And he's got the war which
brings out the worst in people.

Never the good, always
the bad. Always the bad.

But in normal
circumstances he wouldn't

be like this. He'd be all right.

There'd just be the good
aspects of him which...

He's a wonderful crook.

A man who loves good food, good
wine, the ladies, making money...

Killing.

He can't enjoy it.

Bejski told me the other
day, somebody escaped...

from a work detail
outside the wire.

Goeth lined up everybody from
the missing man's barracks.

He shot the man to the left of

Bejski, the man to
the right of him.

He walked down the line shooting
every other man with a pistol.

Twenty-five.

What do you want
me to do about it?

Nothing, nothing.

We're just talking.

"Perlman."

Perlman.

Husband and wife.

Jakob and Chana Perlman.

Have Goldberg bring them over.

Caps off.

Ready for inspection.

(GUESTS SINGING
DRUNKENLY IN GERMAN)

I'm sure this will be better
than those rags, Lisiek.

Mr Director, I was just helping
Lisiek to find something...

to clean the stains from
the Commander's bathtub.

- Go clean it.
- Pardon me, Sir.

You don't have to
report to me, Helen.

You know who I am?

I'm Schindler.

Of course. I have heard and...

you have been here before.

Here, why don't you
keep this some place?

- Go on, take it.
- I get extra food here.

Well, if you don't want to eat it,
trade it. Or give it to Lisiek.

Why not build yourself up?

My first day here, he beat me...

because I threw out the
bones from dinner.

He came down to the basement
at midnight, and he...

he asked me where they were.

For his dogs, you understand?

I said to him, I don't
know how I say this.

I never could say it
now, I said to him...

"Why are you beating me?"

He said, "The reason
I beat you now...

is because you ask
why I beat you."

I know your sufferings, Helen.

It doesn't matter.

I have accepted them.

Accepted them?

One day he will shoot me.

No, no, no, no, he
won't shoot you.

I know. I see things.

We were on the roof on Monday,
young Lisiek and I...

and we saw the Commander come
out of the front door and...

and down the steps by the patio
right there below us and...

and there on the steps he
drew his gun and he...

shot a woman who was passing by.

A woman carrying a bundle.
Through the throat.

Just-Just a woman on her
way somewhere, you know.

She was no fatter or thinner...

or slower or faster
than anyone else...

and I couldn't guess
what had she done.

The more you see of
the Commander...

the more you see there is no set
rules that you can live by.

You can't say to yourself, "If I

follow these rules,
I will be safe."

He won't shoot you because
he enjoys you too much.

He enjoys you so much he won't
even let you wear the star.

He doesn't want anyone else to
know, it's a Jew he's enjoying.

He shot the woman
from the steps...

because she meant nothing to him.

She was one of a series neither
offending or pleasing him.

But you, Helen.

It's all right. It's not
that kind of a kiss.

Thank you.

Here.

Right, the wine.

Wonderful party, Amon. Thank you.

Why do you drink that motor oil?

I send you good
stuff all the time.

Your liver's going to explode
like a hand grenade.

You know, I look at you...

I watch you.

You're never drunk.

Oh, that's...

that's real control.

Control is power.

That's power.

Is that why they fear us?

We have the fucking power to
kill, that's why they fear us.

They fear us because we have
the power to kill arbitrarily.

A man commits a crime,
he should know better.

We have him killed, and we
feel pretty good about it.

Or we kill him ourselves
and we feel even better.

That's not power, though.

That's justice. It's
different than power.

Power is when we have every
justification to kill...

and we don't.

You think that's power?

That's what the emperors had.
A man stole something...

he's brought in
before the emperor...

he throws himself down on the
ground, he begs for mercy.

He knows he's going to die.

And the emperor, pardons him.

This worthless man.
He lets him go.

I think you are drunk.

That's power, Amon.

That, is power.

Amon the good.

I pardon you.

What do they want?

I don't know, but they're in my

office right now
reviewing our books.

As my accountant, tell me,
should I be alarmed...

that the auditors are
reviewing my books?

Or have you done
your job properly?

You needn't be alarmed.

I needn't be alarmed.

I'm sorry, sir.

Do you know how much
this saddle is worth?

Do you know how much it costs?

All right.

All right.

Stern, what the hell are you
doing following me around?

Barracks one, eleven...

fifteen and thirty-two...

apply to inspection area.

She was smoking on the job.

Tell her not to do it again.

I have to report, sir...

I've been unable to remove the
stains from your bathtub.

- What are you using, Lisiek?
- Soap, Commander.

Soap? Not lye?

Go ahead, go on, leave.
Leave, I pardon you.

I pardon you.

Although I am not a rabbi,
in these circumstances...

I pray to the Almighty
that he will forgive me...

if I intone the blessings.

So...

this is where you
come to hide from me.

I came to tell you...

that you, you really are

a wonderful cook and a
well-trained servant.

I mean it. If you need a
reference after the war...

I'd be, I'd be happy
to give you one.

It must get lonely
down here when you're.

Listening to everyone upstairs
having such a good time.

Does it?

You can answer.

But what's the right answer?
That's what you're thinking:

"What does he want to hear?"

The truth, Helen, is
always the right answer.

Yes, you're right.

Sometimes we're both lonely.

Yes. I...

I mean...

I would like so much to...

reach out and touch you
in your loneliness.

What would that be like,
I wonder? I mean...

what would be wrong with that?

I realise that you're
not a person in the...

the strictest sense
of the word, but...

No, maybe you're right about that
too, you know, maybe what's...

what's wrong isn't...

it's not us.

It's, no, it's this.

I mean, when they
compare you to...

to, vermin and to
rodents and to lice...

I just...

No, no, you, you
make a good point.

You make a very good point.

Is this the face of a rat?

Are these the eyes of a rat?

Hath not a Jew eyes?

I feel for you, Helen.

No, I don't think so.

You're a Jewish bitch.

You nearly talked me
into it, didn't you?

Bravo.

- Bravo.
- Cheers. Cheers.

On behalf of the, of
the workers, sir,

I wish for you a happy birthday.

Happy birthday.

Well, the staff, please.

Thank you very much
for the lovely cake.

Thank you very much. Tell
them "Thank you" from me.

The trains arrived and the people
were driven out with clubs.

They were lined up in front
of two big warehouses.

One was marked "Cloak Room"
and the other "Valuables."

And there they were
made to undress.

A Jewish boy handed them pieces of

string to tie their
shoes together.

They shaved their hair.

They told them it
was needed to make

something special
for U-boat crews.

And then they were herded
down a big corridor...

to bunkers with Stars of
David on the doors...

and signs that said "Bath
and Inhalation Room"

SS gave them soap.

They told them to
breathe all the time

because it's good
for disinfecting.

And then they gassed them.

Mila, why soaps?

So that they would agree
to go in, I think.

Come on, Mila, stop
it. Your bedtime

stories are scaring everyone.

- I just don't believe it.
- Ja. You know it's ridiculous.

- I don't believe it either.
- I cannot believe it.

I didn't say I believed
it. I said I heard it.

From who?

From somebody who heard it
from someone who was there.

You know, if they were there,
they would have been gassed.

- Yes.
- It doesn't make any sense.

We're their workforce.

What sense does it make to
kill your own workforce?

To go to all this trouble of
assembling a workforce only to...

No, it can't be true.

We are very, very
important for them.

Yes, we do now. Goodnight.

- Goodnight.
- Goodnight. Sweet dreams.

Attention, attention.

Everyone who is alive...

is to come to the roll-call area.

Attention, attention.

We have to go to the
roll-call area.

- Everyone who is alive...
- The list makers are here.

Is to come to the roll-call area.

There is going to be a selection.

Attention, attention.
Everyone who is alive...

is to come to the roll-call area.

- Gentlemen.
- Gentlemen.

100.000 Hungarian is coming.

(SPEAKING GERMAN INDISTINCTLY)

All stand in a single row.

You could afford to
lose some weight, Amon.

And you've got to cut
down on the cognac.

Morning. What's going on?

It's another semi-annual physical.

There.

I've got another
shipment coming in of...

What are they this time?

- Hungarians.
- Oh, yeah, Hungarians.

We've got to separate the sick
from the healthy to make room.

Look alive, Rebeka.

Quicker.

That's my mechanic.

Whose bright idea was
it to get rid of him?

No, no, no. Wait, go
away. She can work.

Come here. Look, separate
the sick from the healthy.

Those who can work and those
who can't. She can work.

You can work, you can come.

On your feet. On your feet.

Those not selected for transport,
put your clothes back on.

- Go back to the barracks.
- Return to the barracks.

Go back to the barracks.

Oh, my God.

- Olek? Olek?
- Danka?

Olek? Olek?

Olek. Olek.

- Olek?
- Danka?

- Danka?
- Olek?

Back to the barracks. Go
back to your barracks.

I didn't see him.

They're hiding. I'm telling
you, they're hiding.

I know Danka. She
knows a good place.

She took all of them together.

Back to the barracks.

Find your own hiding
place. There's

no room for you here.
Go away, quick.

Get out. This is our
place. Get out.

- Oskar.
- Amon. Gentlemen.

Why didn't you call me?

I tried to call you.
Here, Hujar, move.

- Quite a picnic, huh? Madritsch.
- Oskar.

They're running a
little late, you know?

It's taking longer than I thought.

- A drink?
- Something cold. Bowle.

The Bowle.

Oh, another beautiful day.

(WOMAN SHOUTING IN POLISH)

The loading of the transport
waggons is finished.

We can start.

Water. Water.

Water, water.

- To your health.
- Oh, thank you.

What do you say we get
your fire hoses out

here and hose down
the cars? Thank you.

Indulge me.

- Hujar.
- Yes, sir.

- Go bring the fire hoses.
- Where's the fire?

In the windows.
That's it, that's it.

On the roof. That's
it, good, good.

In the window, in the window.

Come on. Come on.

That's it, more, more.

That's it, that's it. More, more.

This is really cruel, Oskar.
You are giving them hope.

You shouldn't do
that. That's cruel.

Come on, try and reach
the far end. Look out.

- Water.
- More water.

I've got some 200 metre
hoses back in Emalia.

I have 20 metres at
home in my garden.

We can reach the cars at the end.

What? What?

- Hujar.
- Yeah, sure.

Don't forget the roof.

On the roof on the other side.

Water.

Lieutenant, every time
the train stops...

you open the doors, you
give them water, yeah?

- Okay.
- Okay. This car. This car.

I'm not saying you'll
regret it, but you might.

- You should be aware of that.
- We will have to risk regret.

All right, sure. It's a nice day.
I'll go for a drive with you.

What about you?

I violated the Race
and Resettlement Act.

Though I doubt anyone can point
out the actual provision to me.

I kissed a Jewish girl.

Did your prick fall off?

He likes women.

He likes good-looking women.

He sees a beautiful
woman, he doesn't think.

I mean, he has so many women.

And they love him.

Yeah, they love him. I mean, he
is married, yeah, but he's...

All right, no. She was Jewish.
He shouldn't have done it.

But you didn't see this girl.

I saw this girl. This
girl was, woof...

she was very good-looking.

They cast a spell on
you, you know, the Jews.

When you work closely with
them, like I do, you see this.

They have this power.
It's like a virus.

Some of my men are
infected with this virus.

They should be pitied,
not punished.

They should receive treatment.

This is as real as typhus.
I see this all the time.

It's a matter of money?

You're offering me a bribe?

A bribe? No. No, please.
It's a gratuity.

Heil Hitler.

Hello, Amon.

Sit down.

We give you Jewish girls at
five marks a day, Oskar.

You should kiss us, not them.

God forbid you ever get a
real taste for Jewish skirt.

There's no future in it.
They don't have a future.

That's not just good,
old-fashioned, Jew-hating talk.

It's policy now.

Yeah, beautiful, good.

- Again, yes.
- Good.

Come on faster.

Be quick.

Move your ass.

It could be done quicker.

Hurry up, don't sleep.

(CHOIR SINGING REQUIEM)

Only the whole pieces,
leave the small parts.

What's going on here?

You can do it with
your hands, quick.

Come here.

Only the whole pieces, leave
the fucking small parts.

Now you better make it
quick, get rid of this shit.

(CONVERSING IN GERMAN)

That's it. Immortals.
Immortals are all around.

Can you believe this?

As if I don't have enough to
do, they come up with this?

I have to find every rag
buried up here and burn it.

The party's over,
Oskar. They're closing

us down, sending
everybody to Auschwitz.

- When?
- I don't know.

As soon as I can
arrange the shipments.

Maybe 30, 40 days.
That ought to be fun.

- I've been talking to Goeth.
- I know the destination.

These are the evacuation orders.

I'm to help organise
the shipments,

put myself on the last train.

That's not what I
was going to say.

I made Goeth promise me he'll
put in a good word for you.

Nothing bad is going
to happen to you

there. You'll receive
special treatment.

The directives coming in
from Berlin mention...

"Special Treatment"
more and more often.

I'd like to think that's
not what you mean.

Preferential treatment, alright?

Should we invent a
whole new language?

I think so.

You're staying, I take it.

In Krakow? What on earth for?

What for? You have
a business to run.

Of course, you'll have to hire
new workers. Poles, I guess.

They cost a little more, but...

What are you going to do?

You ran my business.

No, I'm going home.

I've done what I came here for.

I've got more money than any
man can spend in a lifetime.

Some day, this is all
going to end, you know.

I was going to say we'll
have a drink then.

I think I better have it now.

Where's the money in

It's good business.

It's good business
in your opinion.

Look, you've got to move them, the

equipment, everything
to Czechoslovakia.

Pay for all that and build another
camp. Doesn't make any sense.

- Look, Amon, it's good for me...
- You're not telling me something.

I know them. I'm familiar with
them. I don't have to train them.

You're not telling me something.

It's good for you.
I'll compensate you.

- That's right.
- It's good for the army.

- Herbert Stier.
- Thank you.

- How many?
- 400, 450.

More, more.

Good morning.

- Feigenbaum, Jakob.
- Wolf. Wolf Wein.

Feigenbaum: Lutek, Jakob,
Nacha. Yes? Nacha.

Nacha, that's right.

And Wolf.

How many?

- 600.
- More.

You can do the same
thing I'm doing.

- You might even make money at it.
- I don't know.

Come on, Julius, I know about the

extra food and clothes
you give them.

Paid for out of your own pocket.
If we make a combined approach...

we could get more than
4,000 out, mine and yours.

- Oskar.
- We could relocate them...

in something like
safety, in Moravia.

I don't know.

How many cigarettes have
you smoked tonight?

Too many.

For every one you
smoke, I smoke half.

- I've done all I can.
- I will not accept that.

- No, Oskar, I can't do any more.
- I will not accept that.

No.

- How many? How many?
- 850, give or take.

Give or take what, Stern?
Count them. How many?

That's it. You can
finish that page.

What... did... Goeth...
say about this?

You just told him how many
people you needed and...

You're not buying them?

You're buying them? You're paying
him for each of these names?

If you were still
working for me, I'd

expect you to talk me out of it.

It's costing me a fortune.

Finish the page and leave
one space at the bottom.

You...

The list is an absolute good.

The list... is life.

All around its margins
lies the gulf.

Oskar, there's a
clerical error here

at the bottom of the last page.

No, there's one more name
I want to put there.

I'll never find a maid
as well trained as her

at Brinnlitz. They are
all country girls.

No.

No.

- One hand of twenty-one.
- No.

If you win, I pay you
7,400 reichsmarks.

No.

- Hit a natural, I make it 14,800.
- No.

If I win, the girl
goes on my list.

I can't wager Helen
in a card game.

Why not?

Wouldn't be right.

She's just going to Auschwitz
Number Two, anyway.

- What difference does it make?
- She's not going to Auschwitz.

I'd never do that
to her. No, I want

her to come back
to Vienna with me.

I want her to come to
work for me there.

- I want to grow old with her.
- Are you mad?

Amon, you can't take her
to Vienna with you.

No, of course I can't.

That's what I'd like to do.

What I can do, if
I'm any sort of a

man, is the next
most merciful thing.

I shall take her into
the woods and shoot

her painlessly in the
back of the head.

What was it you said
for a natural 21?

Was it 14,800?

tables. Say your names clearly.

to this transport

and women to this transport.

Wonderful Olek, wonderful.

You know how we make
ice into water?

Olek, get another one.

Position yourselves
all in a single row.

You'll be pleased
with the level of

efficiency I get
from these workers.

Budzyn, under my command...

was the envy of every other

commandant in the
labour camp system.

- The prisoners, however...
- Excuse me.

They would have rather
been somewhere else.

The train with the women has
already left Plaszow...

and will be arriving
here very shortly.

I know you've had a long journey.

But it's only a short walk
further to the factory...

where hot soup and bread
is waiting for you.

Welcome to Brinnlitz.

- Beans in chunt?
- Beans are the best part.

I don't like beans.

Beans and meat and
potatoes and bread.

That's not the way you make chunt.

- Eggs in chunt?
- Yes.

- I don't like chunt.
- No, you don't.

- What do you like?
- I like caviar.

One day on the fire...

- Oh, yes.
- One day...

Position yourselves in
front of the waggons.

You've got to stay together.

Leave the waggons.
Leave the waggons.

I said, leave the waggons.

Bagaze zostawic.

Faster. Quick. Quick.

What's going on back there?

Move it.

Come on, out. Hurry up, out.

Thirty, thirty-five,
forty, forty-five...

Out.

Get out.

Quicker, get out.

All of you, out.

- Where are the list makers?
- Where are the tables?

Move the line.

Get out.

- Quick. Get out.
- Faster.

Quicker.

Come on, be quick.

Mama, where are we?

- 17, 18, 20...
- They're in Auschwitz.

The train was never routed
here. A paperwork mistake.

Take off your shoes.

Quicker, quicker.

Take off your clothes. Hurry up.

Hurry up. Stay in a row and
take off your clothes.

Quicker.

Quicker.

Take off your clothes
quickly. Hurry up.

Go in, hurry up.

Quicker.

Go to the showers, quickly.

Quicker. Quicker.

Eyes on the necks.

Hands on the shoulders.

- How old are you, mother?
- Sixty-eight.

Cough for me, mother.

They say to fall against
the fence is a kindness.

Don't kill yourself
against the fence, Clara.

If you do, you'll never
know what happened to you.

- How old are you, mother?
- Sixty-six, sir.

- Sir?
- Good morning.

A mistake has been made. We
are not supposed to be here.

We work for Oskar Schindler.
We are Schindler Jews.

- Who is Oskar Schindler?
- He had a factory in Krakow.

- Enamelware.
- A pot maker.

How old are you, mother?

You are not the only industrialist
who needs labour...

Mr Schindler.

I remember earlier this
year, IG Farben ordered...

a trainload of Hungarians
for its chemical factory.

The train came in
through the archway...

and the officer in charge of the

selection went
immediately to work...

and sent 2,000 of them...

straight away to
"special treatment".

It is not my task to
interfere with the

processes that take
place down here.

Why do you think I can help you
if I can't help IG Farben?

Allow me to express the reason.

I'm not making any
judgement about you.

It's just that I know that
in the coming months...

we're all going to
need portable wealth.

I could have you arrested.

I'm protected by powerful
friends. You should know that.

I do not say I am accepting them.

All I say is, I'm not comfortable
with them on the table.

I have a shipment
coming in tomorrow.

I'll cut you 300 units from it.

New ones. These are fresh.

The train comes,
we turn it around.

Yes, yes, yes.

- It's yours.
- I understand.

I want these.

You shouldn't get stuck on names.

That's right. It creates
a lot of paperwork.

Zoldinger, Ernestina.
Waldergrun, Hilda.

Waldergrun, Leonora.

Laast, Anna. Pfefferberg, Mila.

Dresner, Ruth. Dresner, Danka.

Nussbaum, Sidonia. Rosner, Manci.

Hirsch, Helen. Grosz, Chaja
Sara. Seelenfreund, Estella.

Move it. Move it, quick.

- Faster. Faster.
- Come on.

Quick, quick. Faster.

- Faster.
- Hurry up.

No. No. No.

No. No. No.

No. No. No.

Hey. Hey. Hey. What are you doing?

These are mine. These are my

workers. They should
be on my train.

They're skilled munitions
workers. They're essential.

Essential girls.

Their fingers polish the insides
of shell metal casings.

How else am I to polish the inside
of a 45 millimetre shell casing?

You tell me. You tell me.

Back on the train.
Back on the train.

Under Department "W" provisions...

it is unlawful to kill a
worker without just cause.

Under the Businesses
Compensation Fund...

I am entitled to file damage
claims for such deaths.

If you shoot without thinking...

you go to prison, I get paid.

That's how it works.

So, there will be no
summary executions here.

There will be no interference
of any kind with production.

In hopes of ensuring
that, guards will no

longer be allowed on
the factory floor...

without my authorisation.

For your cooperation,
you have my gratitude.

Come on, come.

Oh, boy. I haven't seen something
like that since years.

Come on, boys, come.

No doorman or maitre d' will
ever mistake you again...

I promise.

This is Itzhak Stern,
my accountant.

You must be Mrs Schindler.

It's a pleasure to meet you.

Emilie has volunteered
to work in the clinic.

- Very generous of you.
- I know.

We need to talk when
you have a moment.

This is my wife, Stern. I don't
keep any secrets from my spouse.

Oskar, please, attend to business.
It's much more attractive.

- Madam.
- Hello.

What is it?

We've received an angry complaint
from the Armaments Board.

The artillery shells, tank
shells, rocket casings.

Apparently all of them have
failed quality control tests.

That's to be expected.

Start-up problems.
This isn't pots and

pans. This is a precise business.

- I'll write them a letter.
- They're withholding payment.

Sure, so would I, so
would you. I wouldn't

worry. We'll get it right
one of these days.

There's a rumour you've been going

around miscalibrating
the machines.

They could shut us down,
send us back to Auschwitz.

I'll call around, find out
where we can buy shells.

- Pass them off as ours.
- I don't see the difference...

whether they're made
here or somewhere else.

You don't see a difference?
I see a difference.

You'll lose a lot of money.

Fewer shells will be made. Stern,
if this factory ever produces...

a shell that can actually be
fired, I'll be very unhappy.

- Hello, madam.
- How do you do?

How are you doing, Rabbi? Rabbi.

Good, Mr Director.

Sun's going down.

Yes, it is.

What day is this? Friday?
It is Friday, isn't it?

Is it?

What's the matter with you? You

should be preparing
for the Sabbath.

Shouldn't you?

I've got some wine.
In my office. Come.

What?

Do you have any money,
hidden away some place...

that I don't know about?

No.

Why? Am I broke?

Well...

Yesterday morning, at 2:41 a.m...

at General Eisenhower's
headquarters...

General Jodl...

signed the Act of
Unconditional Surrender...

of all German land, sea and
air forces in Europe...

to the Allied Expeditionary Force.

And simultaneously to the
Soviet High Command.

The German war is,
therefore, at an end.

But let us not forget
for a moment...

I think it's time the guards
came into the factory.

Japan, with all her
treachery and greed...

The unconditional surrender of
Germany has just been announced.

At midnight tonight,
the war is over.

Tomorrow you'll begin
the process...

of looking for survivors
of your families.

In most cases, you
won't find them.

After six long years of murder...

victims are being mourned
throughout the world.

We've survived.

Many of you have come up
to me and thanked me.

Thank yourselves.

Thank your fearless Stern...

and others among you who
worried about you...

and faced death at every moment.

I'm a member of the Nazi party.

I'm a munitions manufacturer.

I'm a profiteer of slave labour.

I am a criminal.

At midnight you'll be
free, and I'll be hunted.

I shall remain with you until
five minutes after midnight...

after which time,

and I hope you'll forgive
me I have to flee.

I know you have received
orders from our commandant...

which he has received
from his superiors

to dispose of the
population of this camp.

Now would be the time to do it.

Here they are, they're all here.
This is your opportunity.

Or you could leave...

and return to your
families as men...

instead of murderers.

In memory of the countless
victims among your people...

I ask us to observe three
minutes of silence.

- Thank you, Mr Jereth.
- Thank you, Mr Jereth.

Open wide.

Thank you, Mr Jereth.

Thank you, Mr Jereth.

As soon as peace occurs, I want...

I want that cloth
distributed to the workers.

Two and a half metres each.

Also, each person is to
get a bottle of vodka.

They won't drink it.
They know its value.

Likewise those Egipshi
cigarettes we organised.

It'll be done. Everything you ask.

We've written a letter,
trying to explain things...

in case you are captured.

Every worker has signed it.

Thank you.

It is Hebrew, from the Talmud.

It says: "Whoever saves one
life, saves the world entire."

I could have got more out.

I could have got
more. I don't know.

If I just...

I could have got more.

Oskar, there are
1,100 people who are

alive because of
you. Look at them.

If I'd made more money...

I threw away so much money.

You have no idea.

If I had just...

There will be generations
because of what you did.

I didn't do enough.

You did so much.

This car...

Goeth would've bought this car.

Why did I keep the car?
Ten people right there.

Ten people.

Ten more people.

This pin...

two people.

This is gold.

Two more people.

He would have given me two
for it, at least one.

He would have given
me one, one more.

One more person.

A person, Stern, for this.

I could have gotten...

one more person and I didn't.

And I didn't.

You have been liberated...

by the Soviet Army.

Have you been in Poland?

I just came from Poland.

Are there any Jews left?

Where should we go?

Don't go east, that's for sure.

They hate you there.

I wouldn't go west
either, if I were you.

We could use some food.

Isn't there a town over there?
