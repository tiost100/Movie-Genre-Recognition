That's it.
100 honours, and 90 below.

Nicely done, Strangways,
I have to give it to you.

I must leave you for a few minutes.
Order a round on my chit, Professor.

Right.

Must you break off
at this time every evening?

My managing director has a call put
through to me every day about this time.

Hurry back.

20 minutes. And don't try
doctoring any hands for me.

Same again.

Bless you, master.

- Hurry, man.
- Get away, quick.

W6N, W6N, W6N.

Calling G7W.

How do you hear me? Over.

G7W London, G7W London.

Receiving you. Over.

Stand by to transmit. Wait. Out.

Here.

Hello, W6N. Over.

Foreman of signals - urgent.

Get me the Ml6 radio security control.

What is it?

W6N Kingston, Jamaica - broken contact
just after they came up on transmission.

- Broken or faded?
- Broken. We still have the carrier wave.

- On both emergency frequencies?
- No joy on either. I'm still calling.

Let me know as soon as they come up.

Foreman of signals, sir.
Jamaica's broken off mid-transmission.

No, sir, it's not a technical fault.

Yes, sir.

Will you tell him, sir?

Very good.

- Excuse me, sir. Are you a member?
- No, I'm looking for Mr James Bond.

- What name should I say?
- Just give him my card.

Would you like to leave
your coat over there?

The house will cover the difference?

- I need another thousand.
- I admire your courage, Miss...?

Trench... Sylvia Trench.

I admire your luck, Mr...?

Bond... James Bond.

Mr Bond, I suppose you wouldn't
care to raise the limit?

I have no objections.

Now...

- Looks like you're out to get me.
- It's an idea, at that.

Eight.

- Excuse me, sir.
- Thank you.

André, I must pass the shoe.

I hope you'll forgive me,
but it's most important.

Have those changed, will you?

Too bad you have to go.
Just as things were getting interesting.

Yes.

Tell me, Miss Trench,
do you play any other games?

I mean, besides chemin de fer?.

Golf, amongst other things.

- Tomorrow afternoon, then.
- Tomorrow?

And we could have dinner
afterwards, perhaps?

Sounds tempting.

May I let you know in the morning?

Splendid.

My number's on the card.

See if he's there, will you?

James, where on earth have you been?
I've been searching London for you.

007 is here, sir.
He'll see you in a minute.

Moneypenny.

- What gives?
- Me. Given an ounce of encouragement.

You never take me
to dinner looking like this.

- You never take me to dinner. Period.
- I would, you know.

Only M would have me court-martialled
for illegal use of government property.

Flattery will get you nowhere.
But don't stop trying. Now...

- What's all this to-do about?
- Strangways. It looks serious.

We've been burning the air between here
and Jamaica for the last three hours.

- In you go.
- Don't forget to write.

Good evening, sir.

It happens to be 3am.
When do you sleep, 007?

Never on the firm's time, sir.

Sit down.

Jamaica went off the air,
in the middle of the opening procedure.

We've checked up
and Strangways has disappeared.

So has his secretary.
We'd only just sent her out there.

Was Strangways on something special?

An inquiry from the Americans.

There is massive interference
with their Cape Canaveral rockets.

They think it comes
from the Jamaica area.

- Does "toppling" mean anything to you?
- A little.

Throwing the controls of a guided missile
off balance with a radio beam.

Five million dollars' worth of missile
aimed at a spot in the South Atlantic

and finishing up in the Brazilian jungle
is bad enough.

But now they're gonna try orbiting
a rocket round the moon.

The American CIA sent a man down
to work with Strangways.

A fellow by the name of Leiter.

I've heard of him, but never met him.
Has he found out anything important?

You'd better ask him.
You're on the 7 o'clock plane to Kingston.

That gives you exactly
three hours 22 minutes.

Armourer.

You'll get the background papers
at the airport, in a self-destructor bag.

You can study them during the flight.

I want to know
what's happened to Strangways.

Sir.

Take off your jacket.

Give me your gun.

This damn Beretta again.
I've told you about this before.

You tell him, for the last time.

Nice and light, in a lady's handbag.

- No stopping power.
- Any comments, 007?

I disagree. I've used a Beretta for
ten years and never missed with it yet.

But it jammed on your last job
and you spent six months in hospital.

A double-O number means you're
licensed to kill, not get killed.

Since I've been head of Ml7, there's
been a 40 drop in double-O casualties.

I want it to stay that way.
You'll carry the Walther.

Unless you'd prefer to go back
to standard intelligence duties.

No, sir. I would not.

Then from now on
you carry a different gun. Show him.

Walther PPK: 7.65 mil with a delivery
like a brick through a plate-glass window.

Takes a Brausch silencer
with little reduction in muzzle velocity.

- The CIA swear by them.
- Thank you, Major Boothroyd.

Thank you, sir.

- Any questions, 007?
- No, sir.

- All right. Best of luck.
- Thank you, sir.

- 007.
- Sir?

Just leave the Beretta.

Miss Moneypenny, forget
the usual repartee. 007's in a hurry.

Ciao.

Good luck.

There. Now you made me miss it.

You don't miss a thing.
How did you get in here?

I decided to accept your invitation.

That was for tomorrow afternoon.

Do you always dress this way for golf?

I changed into something more
comfortable. I hope I did the right thing.

You did the right thing,
but you picked the wrong moment.

- I have to leave immediately.
- That's too bad.

Just as things were
getting interesting again.

When did you say you had to leave?

Immediately.

Almost immediately.

Hello, New York. Your Pan Am 323
just landed Kingston, Jamaica.

Taxi.

- All right, then. Go ahead.
- Help yourself.

- Taxi.
- Mr Bond, sir?

Yes?

I'm Mr Jones,
chauffeur from Government House.

That's fine. We can drop
my luggage off on the way.

- I want to check my reservation.
- I can do that.

No, no. You just take care of the bags.

- Government House?
- Yes.

- Principal Secretary, please.
- Hold the line, please.

- Who wants him?
- James Bond, Universal Exports.

Welcome to Jamaica, Mr Bond.

Yes, your head office
alerted us this morning.

- Are you free for lunch at one o'clock?
- That'll suit me fine.

- By the way, have you sent a car for me?
- Car? I didn't think you wanted one.

Quite right.
One o'clock, then.

Forgive me if I'm a few minutes late.

- Where to first?
- Government House, but there's no hurry.

Just take me for a ride.

Do you always drive this fast?
I told you I wasn't in a hurry.

Sorry, sir, but I think
there's some fellow trying to follow us.

Then I suggest you try and lose them.

Take the next turning on the right.

Now, Mr Jones. Talk fast,
before your friend doubles back.

Who are you working for?

I don't know what you're talking about.
I was just sent to meet you at the airport.

- But by whom?
- By...

- Government House.
- I don't think so.

Both hands on the wheel.
I'm a very nervous passenger.

Get out. Move!

Keep your hands where I can see them.

Get up.

- Now talk.
- All right.

Let me have a cigarette.

To hell with you.

Sergeant, make sure he doesn't get away.

Cyanide in a cigarette? Fantastic.

- No less.
- Duff, what have you got for us?

The car was stolen and we haven't
been able to identify the driver yet.

But he surely wasn't a Kingston man.

- Well, news of my arrival leaked.
- We didn't advertise it, I can assure you.

Perhaps not. I got the impression
someone had been selling tickets.

Anything more we can do for you?

I want to meet the last people
to see Strangways.

Nobody seems to have seen him
after he left our bridge four.

- Who were the others?
- Professor Dent...

Metallurgist, runs a test laboratory.
Respected. Clean bill.

- Potter...
- Old general. Been here for ages.

- We'll start with those.
- Want them brought in?

- Lord, no. I want to meet them socially.
- I can introduce you at the club.

- I'd like to see Strangways' place.
- I'll run you up there now.

Go on in.

That's her blood patch.

- They've grouped it as O Rh positive.
- That's her group, all right.

The set was still switched on
when we came round.

We tried to get through,
but it was dead the other end.

And it'll stay dead. All frequencies are
changed immediately security's broken.

Receipt from Dent Laboratories.

- Geology a hobby of Strangways?
- Not that I know of, no.

Who's the man with Strangways?

- One of the local fishermen.
- He drove the car that tailed me.

Is that so? That gives us something
to work on. I'll have him checked.

You do that. I want to change
before I meet Pleydell-Smith at the club.

One medium-dry vodka martini.
Mixed like you said, and not stirred.

- Anything else, sir?
- No, that's all.

Curious, old Strangways
just vanishing like that.

Or is it? Cherchez la femme.
His secretary was very nice indeed.

- Did you know her?
- I've seen her around.

None of you can throw any light
on what happened to him?

His conversation? Any hint?

I never heard him talk about anything
but big-game fishing and bridge.

He got the fishing bug three weeks ago.
He's been out practically every day since.

It must have cost him something.

These fishermen ask the earth to charter,
and Quarrel's the most expensive of all.

- Quarrel?
- A Cayman Islander.

- He keeps a boat in the harbour.
- I see.

Thank you.

Excuse me.
Where do I find Quarrel?

He him.

Your name Quarrel?

Maybe.

I'm a friend of Commander Strangways.

Ain't that nice?
I like people who's friends of people.

I thought you might be able
to tell me what happened to him.

As far as I know, nothing happened.

Unless you know different.

Where did you take him in your boat?

You see that, captain?
That there's the Caribbean.

That's where. Fishing.

I'm interested in fishing.
I'd like to charter your boat.

It's not for hire.

Seems I came to the wrong address.

That's all right.

If you'll excuse me,
I got business to attend to.

Pussfeller.

Well, if it ain't my friend
what gets addresses mixed.

You got the right one this time
if you likes good eating.

I do, if the conversation matches it.

Back at the boat too public.
In there it different.

After you.

Sure thing.

- Hey, man! You see we get some privacy.
- Nothing but, Quarrel.

- Take a seat.
- I'm fine.

OK, mister.
Supposin' you start the conversation.

How's about it?

Ain't no use you struggling.
Pussfeller wrestles alligators.

Right! Up slowly and face that wall.

Hold it.

Gently, bud, gently.
Let's not get excited.

Frisk him.

Nothing.

Interesting.
Where were you measured for this?

My tailor, Savile Row.

Is that so? Mine's a guy in Washington.

Felix Leiter.
Central Intelligence Agency.

- You must be James Bond.
- You mean we're fighting the same war?

When I saw you leave the airport with
the opposition, I figured I must be wrong.

This is Quarrel.

- No hard feelings, I hope?
- Only a sore hand. Glad to know you.

- Pussfeller owns the place.
- I hope he cooks better than he fights.

Nobody died from my cooking - yet.

There you are.
Cape Canaveral is screaming.

They don't want anything to go wrong
with this moon rocket launch.

Yet Strangways didn't think
the interference came from here?

- I suppose you cased the joint?
- I checked unofficially.

You limeys can be touchy
about trespassing.

Strangways and Quarrel
checked the islands.

You found nothing?
Where did you look?

Just about everywhere.
Fire Island, Crab Key, Morgan's Reef.

- Checked them all thoroughly?
- All except Crab Key. We had no right.

- Why not?
- It belongs to a Chinese...

Get her, Quarrel, and the camera.

Evening, missis.

You're hurting.

The captain wants you
to have a drink with us.

- You're hurting me.
- You can't mean it.

Good evening.

- Why do you want another picture of me?
- I only got your hat at the airport.

- Tell this ape to let me go.
- Why do you want a picture at all?

Because that's the way I earn my living.

Who pays you?

The Daily Gleaner.

Pussfeller. Pussfeller.

- Anything I can do?
- Ever seen this girl before?

She come here sometimes.
You want for me to get rid of her?

No. Just ring the Gleaner. Find out
if they sent a photographer here tonight.

They didn't send me. I work freelance.

Freelance? For whom?

You...

Tell us and he'll stop.

We don't get nothing out of this gal.
You want me to break her arm?

Another time.

The second time nothing's come out.
Give her her arm back.

Run along, freelance.

You'll be sorry.
You'll all be sorry, you rats.

One takes cyanide, another would have
had her arm broken. Neither would talk.

- Who puts that sort of scare into people?
- I think maybe we'd better find out fast.

You were talking about Crab Key?
Why can't we go there?

It belongs to a Chinese character.
He won't allow anyone to land.

I had our naval reconnaissance planes
take a look.

They found nothing but a bauxite mine.
Low-scan CH radar setup.

- There's nothing illegal about that.
- Crab Key scares me plenty.

Friends of mine went out
there once after seashells.

Only trouble, they never came back again.

The local fishermen won't go near it.

Strangways and me, we slip in at night.

He take some samples, we came straight
back. Don't do to hang about there.

- What kind of samples?
- Bits of rock, sand, water.

I see.

Crab Key begins to interest me.

What else do we know
about this Chinese gentleman?

Nothing much. Except his name.

Dr No.

- I'd like to see Professor Dent.
- Have you an appointment?

James Bond.
We met yesterday at the club.

Very well.
He's somewhere in the lab.

Is Professor Dent there?

Oh, never mind.

Morning, Professor.

Mr Bond.
Anything I can do for you?

Yes. I came across this
in Strangways' office.

Your receipt.

- Yes, that's right.
- Can you tell me anything about it?

Poor old Strangways.
Bit of a bug of his, this amateur geology.

He brought some samples in for testing,
convinced they were valuable.

Were they?

Of course not.
Just low-grade iron pyrites.

- Can I see them?
- I threw 'em away.

- Do you know where he found them?
- No, he didn't say.

- Crab Key, perhaps?
- Definitely not.

- Why so certain?
- Not geologically possible.

Thank you, Professor. It's very kind of you
to spare me your time.

You're very welcome, Mr Bond.

Professor...

Allow me.

Morning.

- I have to get to Crab Key.
- You know the procedure.

There's no time for that.
I'll take responsibility.

- Man, I hope you know what you're doing.
- Come on.

- I radioed. They're expecting me.
- Go ahead.

Sit down.

Why have you disobeyed
my strictest rule and come in daylight?

I had to.
Bond came to see me this morning.

Yes, I know. I gave orders that he should
be killed. Why is he still alive?

- Our attempts failed.
- Your attempts failed.

I do not like failure. You are not
going to fail me again, Professor.

No. I came to warn you.

- Warn me?
- Tell you.

Bond has discovered
those rock samples came from Crab Key.

He's not a fool.
He's sure to come out here.

I hope not. If he does,
I shall hold you responsible.

Do I make myself clear?

Yes, quite clear.

Go to the table.

You see what is in the cage?

Pick it up.

Pick it up.

Tonight.

- I'd like to send a cable.
- Yes, of course.

The car you ordered has been delivered.
It's in number five parking lot.

- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night, Mr Bond.

- Morning, Pleydell-Smith.
- Bond.

Sorry to trouble you so early. I need
all you have on Dr No and Crab Key.

Miss Taro, bring me the files on Dr No.

- What do you know about this island?
- Not much, except there's a bauxite mine.

Dr No runs it like a concentration camp.

I've heard rumours,
but no one's complained officially.

- Miss Taro, just leave them here.
- We can't find them anywhere.

- What do you mean? Who had them last?
- Commander Strangways. Both files.

All right, Miss Taro.

Damn nuisance,
their disappearing like that.

On the contrary.

I'd have been surprised if they hadn't.

By the way, that came for you
from London, in the diplomatic pouch.

A present from home.

Can I get out that way?

That's a naughty habit -
listening at keyholes.

I wasn't listening.
I was looking for those files.

Anything that can't be found,
I get the blame.

Forget it.
It's not very important anyhow.

I'd hate to think you were spending
all afternoon looking for them.

No. I have the afternoon off.

There's a coincidence. So have I.
Why don't you show me round the island?

What should I say to an invitation
from a strange gentleman?

You should say yes.

I should say maybe.

Three o'clock at my hotel... maybe?

- Yes, maybe.
- Good.

The luminous dial activates it.
Hold this.

Where exactly did
Strangways place those samples?

- About where your feet is, sir.
- Good.

- Hi, there.
- Hi.

- Lose something?
- Take a look at this Geiger reading.

Those samples Strangways brought back
from Crab Key were radioactive.

Yet Professor Dent told me they were
worthless chunks of iron ore.

- He's either a bad professor or a poor liar.
- I intend to find out which.

Quarrel, how soon can you
get us over to Crab Key?

Well, it's like this here, captain.

Strangways, he done take samples
of all the islands.

- We could check the nearest ones first.
- No. It's Crab Key I'm interested in.

I done take the commander there.
We got away without trouble.

It don't do for a man
to tempt providence too often.

- You see, there's a dragon.
- What?

Native superstition.
Started by Dr No, probably.

All right, Quarrel. We won't force you.

Leiter and I will go after dark,
if you'll give us directions.

I gets my navigational directions
from my nose, my ears - my instincts.

Anyway, I'll be here about seven.

Fine.

Mr Bond, there's
a telephone message for you.

Johnny, what have you done with it?

Hello?

Mr Bond.

I was thinking, why don't you
collect me at my apartment?

It's lovely up here in the mountains.
Nice and cool.

All right.

You leave the Port Royal road
out of Kingston,

then along the Windward Road,
until you get to the cement factory.

Then you turn left.

Follow the road up the hill,
down the other side,

then two miles further on, on the left,

Magenta Drive 239.

I'll be waiting for you.

How did it happen?

I think they were
on their way to a funeral.

Just a minute.

- You did invite me, remember?
- Of course.

I just didn't expect you here so soon.

Yes, come in.

I'll just go and put some clothes on.

Don't go to any trouble on my account.

Please.

Forgive me. I thought I was
invited up here to admire the view.

I feel one of us should answer it.

Hello.

Yes. I know, he's here now.

I don't know what happened.

Right. I'll try and keep him here
for a couple of hours.

I'll have to go now.
I'll call you later.

You believe in living dangerously.
I can see that.

What do you mean?

Sitting around with wet hair,
you'll die of pneumonia.

- It's rather beautiful.
- Thank you.

- Do you always wear it up?
- Don't you like it that way?

Yes, very much.

With your sort of face, it's wonderful.

- What's going on behind my back?
- Nothing.

Look. No hands.

I'm hungry. Let's go out and eat.

- I'll make you a Chinese dinner here.
- I'm feeling Italian and musical.

- Let's go to the Blue Mountain Grill.
- I'd rather stay here.

It's more fun... alone.

Yes, but I don't want you
getting dishpan hands.

- I like cooking.
- Forget it. May I use your phone?

Who are you ringing?

Taxi.

James Bond here. Can I have
a car sent to 2171 Magenta Drive?

As soon as you can, please.
Thank you.

- I thought you came by car.
- Damn thing wouldn't start.

That explains...

Explains what?

Why you need a taxi.

Why I need a taxi?

Careful - my nail varnish.

- The lights.
- No, I always leave them on.

- What's going on?
- Book her, Superintendent, will you?

And...

be careful of her nail varnish.

Drop it, Professor, and behind you.

It's funny, I thought you'd turn up
sooner or later. Sit down.

The girl talked?

But of course.

I was suspicious
at the Queens Club anyhow.

You were the only one
who'd seen Strangways' new secretary.

And then later at the lab,

you made no reference to the fact that
Strangways' samples were radioactive.

Very clever, Mr Bond.

You're up against more than you know. If
you shoot me, you'll end like Strangways.

- And you killed him?
- He was killed, but never mind how.

Who are you working for, Professor?

You might as well know, as you won't live.
I'm working for...

It's a Smith & Wesson.
And you've had your six.

- Better late than never.
- Everything ready?

Yeah, for the last two hours.

Don't worry, Quarrel. It'll be fine.

Bottom part of where my belly
used to be tells me different.

For me, Crab Key will be
a gentle relaxation.

- From what? Dames?
- No, from being a clay pigeon.

This is as far as we go with the engine.
Make with paddle and wind from now on.

OK.

- Let me go with you.
- No, we settled that. It's my beat.

But it's my head in the noose
if anything gets unstuck.

Canaveral can only wait
48 hours for that moonshot.

If we're not back in 12, then it's your beat.
You'd better bring your marines with you.

Quarrel, if you see a dragon, get in first
and breathe on him, you hear?

With all that rum in you, he'll die happy.

Better drop the sail
in case their radar's on scan.

Hard about, captain. Now!

Cover it up.

We'd better get some sleep before
it gets light. I'll be down this end.

Who is that?

It's all right. I'm not supposed
to be here, either. I take it you're not.

- Are you alone?
- What are you doing? Looking for shells?

- No, I'm just looking.
- Stay where you are.

- I promise I won't steal your shells.
- I promise you you won't, either.

- Stay where you are.
- My intentions are strictly honourable.

What's your name?

- Ryder.
- Ryder what?

Honey Ryder.

- What's so funny about it?
- Nothing. It's a very pretty name.

- What's your name?
- James.

Honey, did you use your sail
all the way up to the reef here?

Of course. I always do.

Then they'll know we're here.
They have radar.

My boat is too small to be noticed.
And I often come here to get the shells.

At first they tried to catch me,
but they couldn't.

- Now they don't bother any more.
- They will this time.

- Don't bother with those now.
- Don't bother?

Are they valuable?

This one is worth $50 in Miami. 50.

You promise you won't tell anyone?

I promise.

- Hey, come and take a look.
- It's all right. He's with me.

Captain, what do you think of that?

What's the matter?

That's a high-powered boat.
Take some cover. Come on.

They're here all right.

OK, folks!
Come out and you won't get hurt.

Stand up and show yourselves
or I'll be forced to open fire.

Come on out.
We know you're there.

We've been expecting you. Walk out
with your hands up and you'll be OK.

- This is your last chance.
- He's bluffing. Keep your head down.

All right! You've been warned. This is it.

Lie still. It won't last long.
They don't really know we're here.

Fire!

Are you coming out?

All right, then.

We'll be back.

We'll be back with the dogs.
Full speed ahead.

I warned you about this place.

That was a machine gun, not a dragon.

- There's a dragon here, too.
- She's right.

- You've seen it?
- Yes, I have.

He had two glaring eyes, a short tail,
pointed wings, and was breathing fire.

You don't believe me, do you?

Little gal, I does. I tell you, Mr Bond,
let's get the hell outta here.

Listen, both of you.
There are no such things as dragons.

You saw something that looked like one.
I'm trying to think what it was.

How do you know there aren't?
Did you ever see a mongoose dance?

Or a scorpion with sunstroke
sting itself to death?

Or a praying mantis
eat her husband after making love?

- I hate to admit it, but I haven't.
- Well, I have.

She's right.

All right, they've gone.
Honey, you're getting out of here.

I'm getting out when I'm ready,
and that's never in daylight.

This time you are, and fast.
Where's your boat?

Fetch my shoes.

Look! Look what they've done.
It's all your fault.

I'm sorry. I'll get you a new boat
when we get back to Kingston.

What are we going to do with her now?

If you like, I know
a good place where we can hide.

That'll do for a start.
Leave the things you don't need. Quick!

- Must we come this way?
- Yes. It throws the dogs off the scent.

- Damn mosquitoes.
- Rub water all over yourself.

It's the salt they're after.

Quick! They's coming, across there.

Quarrel, cut some of those reeds.
Give me the knife.

Over there.

They're coming closer.

- Keep quiet.
- Something's biting me.

If you disturb the mud,
they'll know we're here. Get down.

Looks like they're onto something.

Get down.

- Why?
- Because I had to.

He sure knew his business,
trailing us after we let the others pass.

We must get out of here.
Where is this hiding place?

Up there.

Come on.

You smell nicer already.

Thank you.

Mr Bond, quick!

- What is it now?
- Look at these.

Those are dragon tracks.

That's where he breathed.

You ought to get some rest if you want to.
I stay out here on watch.

- In case he comes a-Iooking for us.
- Right. I'll take the second watch.

We'll be out of here by midnight.

I never met a detective before.

- Are you going to arrest Dr No?
- Someone is.

We can't have him trying
to kill everyone who comes here.

He doesn't just try.

- I'm pretty sure he killed my father.
- What do you mean by that?

You see, my father
was a marine zoologist.

We came to the Caribbean
for him to study seashells.

Then one day he came to Crab Key,
and I never saw him again.

They said he must have been drowned,
but he was far too good a diver for that.

Didn't the police investigate?
Or your family?

They investigated for a long time.

Then they said
"Missing, presumed dead".

I haven't got any family.
There was only my father and me.

You mean you're here all alone?
Where did you live before?

All over the world.

The Philippines, Bali, Hawaii.
Anywhere there were shells.

- You went to school somewhere?
- No need. We had an encyclopedia.

I started at A when I was eight,
and now I've reached T.

I bet I know a lot more things than you do.

Didn't anyone in Kingston help?

Well, there was this man who owned
the place where we were living.

He let me stay on
for a while without paying.

Then one night he came up
to my room... Well, you know.

I scratched his face, and then...
But he was stronger than I was.

What happened after that?

I put a black widow spider
underneath his mosquito net.

A female, and they're the worst.
It took him a whole week to die.

Did I do wrong?

Well, it wouldn't do to make a habit of it.

Do you have a woman of your own?

Captain, quick! Down here.

Whatever's coming,
it's coming this way.

This time I want to see it.

And hurry -
there's less than 12 hours to go.

Stay where you are. All of you.
Stay right where you are.

OK, captain.
If that ain't a dragon, what is it?

A dragon that runs on diesel engines.
Forget the spooks.

You take the driver.
I'll take the headlights and the tyres.

You keep safe out of sight.

- I told you to stay there.
- I was frightened.

Come on out.
Hands where we can see 'em.

And the dame. Quick.

Unless you want an extra navel.

Hold it. Drop that gun.

Now kick it away from you.

The girl stays where she is.
Walk towards me, hands out in front.

Come on.

Hey, you.
Where do you think you're going?

Sorry we ain't got any flowers.
Come on, let's go.

Come on. Let's go.

Give me that knife.

- Leave him alone.
- Get out of the way.

Get inside.
Keep an eye on the man.

And be careful. They've been
in the swamp and they're contaminated.

Check their Geiger reading.

- He's reading 95, chief.
- She's 88.

Too much for the monitor.
Scrub them down, but quick.

- Reading 72.8.
- The mud's soaked into their clothes.

All right, then. Take off all their clothes.

- What's he going to do?
- Do as he says. We're contaminated.

- Do the girl first.
- We give the orders around here.

That's fine, but do something
about this, will you? Come here.

Use the high-temperature jets.
Full pressure.

68.

- She's reading 47.
- All right. Put the man through.

He's now clocking 40.

Reading 38.

32.

- Down to 8.
- Hold the girl.

He's now 18.

He's now at 8.

- Practically zero. She's clear.
- Get the man ready.

- He's got a count of four.
- Check his fingernails.

Put your hand in there.

- He's OK.
- I will notify reception they are coming.

Decontamination here.
They're coming through now.

Come in.

Come in.
You poor dears.

We didn't know when to expect you. First
it was teatime yesterday, then dinner.

It was only half an hour ago
we really knew you were on your way.

Cigarette?
American, English, or Turkish?

I'm Sister Rose, this is Sister Lily. We'll
make your stay as pleasant as possible.

- That's most kind of you, but...
- Of course. You want to see your rooms.

Breakfast is ordered,
and then you'll want to sleep.

The doctor left orders you're not
to be disturbed until this evening.

He'll be delighted if you join him
for dinner. Shall I say you will?

- Tell him I also will be delighted.
- Splendid. I know he'll be pleased.

Here we are.

This will be your room, Mr Bond.

This is your bathroom in here.

And for you, young lady...

this is your room.

You'll find fresh clothes in here.

I hope they fit.
We didn't get your sizes till last night.

Don't hesitate to ring
if there's anything at all you want.

Such as two air tickets to London?

I'll leave you two dear people in peace.

- Let's have some breakfast.
- How can you eat at a time like this?

Because I'm hungry and we don't know
when we'll get the chance to eat again.

Take this.

Careful. The whole place
is probably wired for sound.

Have you...

Have you any idea
what they'll do with us?

No idea.

No door handles or windows, either.

- It's a prison, then.
- Mink-lined with first-class service.

What's the matter?

I don't feel so good.

I feel so sleepy.

Damn coffee.

How do you feel?

Sleepy.

- What made us pass out like that?
- The coffee. It was drugged.

It's time for dinner.
We mustn't keep the doctor waiting.

That would never do.
You ready, Honey?

I suppose so.

You're doing fine.

Come on.

Am I properly dressed for the occasion?

- Quite suitable.
- Suitable for what?

This way, please.

I'm glad your hands are sweating, too.

Of course I'm scared, too.
Be natural and leave all the talking to me.

In here, please.

I hope you enjoy your dinner.

Come and look.

Artificial light. We could be
hundreds of feet beneath the sea here.

Look at that. Sea tulips.
They do not grow above 200ft.

One million dollars, Mr Bond.

- You were wondering what it cost.
- As a matter of fact I was.

Forgive my not shaking hands.
It's awkward with these. A misfortune.

You were admiring my aquarium.

Yes. It's quite impressive.

A unique feat of engineering,
if I may say so. I designed it myself.

The glass is convex, ten inches thick,
hence the magnifying effect.

Minnows pretending they're whales.
Just like you on this island, Dr No.

It depends, Mr Bond, on which side
of the glass you are.

A medium dry martini,
lemon peel, shaken, not stirred.

- Vodka?
- Of course.

We'll have dinner at once.

There's so much to discuss, so little time.

Dr No, you haven't done badly,
considering.

A handicap is what you make of it.

I was the unwanted child
of a German missionary

and a Chinese girl of good family.

Yet I became treasurer of the most
powerful criminal society in China.

It's rare for the Tongs to trust anyone
who isn't completely Chinese.

I doubt they shall do so again.

I escaped to America
with ten million of their dollars in gold.

That's how you financed this operation.

It was a good idea to use atomic power.
I'm glad you can handle it properly.

I'd hate to think your decontamination
chamber wasn't effective.

My work has given me
a unique knowledge of radioactivity,

but not without costs, as you see.

Yes.

Your power source had
our organisation puzzled for some time.

They are still puzzled.

Not any longer.
I sent a complete report.

You've not contacted your headquarters
since you requested a Geiger counter.

But there are so many files
open on you already, Dr No.

Our own, the CIA's...

The one from the Tong society
that you robbed.

When trouble comes, you'll find this is
a very small and naked little island.

An expendable little island, Mr Bond.

When my mission is accomplished,
I destroy it and move on.

But the habit of enquiry is consistent.
You're wondering why, where, when.

I only gratify your curiosity

because you're the one man capable of
appreciating what I have done...

and keeping it to himself.

Just a minute. There's no point involving
the girl. She has nothing to do with us.

Let her go free.
She'll promise not to talk.

- No, I'm staying with you.
- I don't want you here.

I agree. This is no place
for the girl. Take her away.

No.

- No.
- I'm sure the guards will amuse her.

Let me go!

That's a Dom Pérignon '55.
It would be a pity to break it.

I prefer the '53 myself.

Clumsy effort, Mr Bond.
You disappoint me.

I'm not a fool,
so please do not treat me as one.

And that table knife, please put it back.

We can't all be geniuses, can we?

Does the toppling of American missiles
really compensate for having no hands?

Missiles are the first step
to prove our power.

Our power? Your disregard for human life
means you must be working for the East.

East, West - just points of the compass,
each as stupid as the other.

- I'm a member of SPECTRE.
- SPECTRE?

Special Executive for Counterintelligence,
Terrorism, Revenge, Extortion.

The four cornerstones of power, headed
by the greatest brains in the world.

Correction. Criminal brains.

The successful criminal brain
is always superior. It has to be.

Why become criminal? The West would
welcome a scientist of your calibre.

The Americans are fools.
They refused my services.

So did the East.
Now they can both pay for their mistake.

World domination.
That same old dream.

Our asylums are full of people
who think they're Napoleon or God.

You persist in trying to provoke me.
I could've had you killed in the swamp.

And why didn't you?

I thought you less stupid.
Usually, when a man gets in my way...

But you were different.
You cost me time, money, effort.

You damaged my organisation,
and my pride.

I was curious to see what you were like.

I thought there might be
a place for you with SPECTRE.

I'm flattered.

I'd prefer the revenge department.

Of course, my first job would be finding
the killer of Strangways and Quarrel.

Unfortunately I misjudged you.
You are just a stupid policeman...

whose luck has run out.

They're waiting for you
in the control room, Dr No.

No hurry. They won't have started
their countdown check yet.

You won't get away with it this time.
The Americans are prepared for trouble.

I never fail, Mr Bond.

- What do we do with him?
- Soften him up. I haven't finished yet.

Have you got new fuel elements loaded?

All ready, sir.

The roadblock is about 3,000 feet away.

Everyone in that area is pulled back.
No traffic allowed.

The launch area is completely
cleared for safety...

The vehicle is now at
its full weight of 240 tons.

All the automatic transistors
have been put onto the vehicle.

We will run up to half power
for 30 seconds.

Control interlocks free.
Fuel elements 12.5.

Control?

Control rod actuators operating.
Core temperature 113.

- Converters?
- Standing by. Ignition heaters on.

- Energy stabilisers?
- Energy steady at.8 megawatts.

Tracking stations are plugged into
the control centre at Cape Canaveral.

Fuel elements?

Fuel elements.
Where's Chang?

Chang, what are you doing there?
Get on the gantry.

Hurry.

- Shut down.
- Shut down reactor.

This is Mercury Control.
The countdown for the MV...

Reactor shutdown,
temperature 227, falling.

- Converters off.
- Converters off.

- Radiation reading.
- Radiation zero.

Shutdown procedure complete.
Reactor safe.

Stand by.

This is Mercury Control. The check
indicates all systems are go at this time.

The countdown is now four minutes,
30 seconds and counting.

This is Mercury Control.

The spacecraft pilot, the launch,
the tracking crew in case of emergency,

and now even the weatherman,
have given us the word go.

Remain on standby.
Approximately two minutes to go.

Control rod actuators standing by.

Converters standing by.

Synchronise radio beam for toppling.

Synchronising radio beam for toppling.

Radio beam synchronised for toppling.
Zeroed on the rocket now.

We will now stay on
Mercury Spacecraft Control...

Stand by.

Run to full power.
Fuel elements 21.

Attention all controls.
Going into operation now.

The umbilical is retracted.

All elements of progress and operation
have reported they are in good condition.

We're at T minus 19 seconds
and counting.

T minus 15...

Ten, nine, eight, seven...

Shut down, you fools. It's running wild.
Shut down.

...two, one, zero.

Liftoff!

It's a very hot rocket.

You can see the flame of it
against the grey of the cumulus.

Up in the sunlight, beginning to gleam.
A very good, steady climb...

All systems go! Go! Go!

Honey! Honey!

Honey!

- Where's the girl I came in with?
- I don't know.

Where's the girl they brought in with me?

- Number twelve.
- Show me.

We've run out of fuel.

What are we going to do now?

- Well, we can swim, or...
- Or what?

Come here.

Ahoy, Mr Bond.

Well, well. What's the matter?
Do you need help?

- I'm quite sure you don't.
- Now that you're here, give us a tow.

Throw us your line.
