Exactly three years ago,

I promised you a president

who feels your pain
and who shares your dreams.

I wanna talk to you about a fundamental
threat to American democracy.

For the first time
in the history of our country,

a majority of
our people believe

that the next five years

will be worse
than the past five years.

Shit.

Howdy, folks.

Apologize for the delay.

We're number 11
for takeoff.

We'll try to make it up
in the air.

Just wake me up
over Texas.

Apologies
from the flight deck.

Just a little bit
of turbulence.

Thank you all
for flying TWA tonight.

Welcome to Baton Rouge.

The people's choice...

...and for you history buffs,
is in Louisiana...

Hey, Luce.

Um, back here.

Thank you
for flying TWA.

Welcome to Vancouver.

Welcome to Bakersfield.

Welcome to Denver.

I hope they put us up
at the Holiday Inn tonight.

Those little cocktail
gals are on fire.

Soon as they see a man in
uniform, panties come off.

About that landing
in Detroit.

Oh, man.
It was gusty that day.

One in Kentucky.

Thanks, Bobby.

Hey. Chivas on the rocks.

Barry.

What was that?

Barry Seal.

That's right.

You have a drop off and pick up
service here every other Thursday.

Cuban exiles.

They pay commercial pilots to
smuggle homegrown contraband

through Canadian hubs.
Vancouver, Montreal.

Right?

I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

No?
No.

You're smuggling cigars.

You have an interesting
file, Barry.

"File"?

Starts off with a bang.

Top of your class in
the Civil Air Patrol.

Youngest pilot
in TWA history.

You were going places.

What is going on here?

Revolution's in the air,
Barry.

Central America, right now.

We're building nations
down there, Barry.

We're building nations.

It's America at
its fucking finest.

And we could use
someone like you.

Goddamn.

You're CIA.

Shh.

Holy shit.

Hot damn!
Look at her.

Well, they, uh, they
tell me she's pretty fast.

Yeah. Yeah.

It's the fastest twin-engine
on the planet. Mmm.

I mean, shit!

She looks like she's going 300
miles an hour just sitting there.

CIA owns this?

No. No.

Uh, Independent
Aviation Consultants.

IAC.

Yeah.

Well, what is that?
What do they call them?

One of them front groups?
Is that...

No, no, no. It's as real as IBM.
Uh-huh.

You'd run the company,
but after hours, you work for us.

Yeah.

Takes pictures?
Mmm.

We say it
"collects intelligence."

Uh-huh.

Where? Russia?

Uh...

South of the border,
north of the equator.

Let's just say, uh,
"enemies of democracy."

Look, the real work is covert.
You understand? So...

"Covert."

So, uh, anyone
finds out about it,

uh, family, friends, even Lucy.
It's Lucy, right?

Yeah, that's right.

That'd be a problem.

What?

All this is legal?

If you're doing it
for the good guys, yeah.

Just don't get caught.

You wanna take
her for a spin?

Fuck it! Take her
for a fucking spin!

I want you to
take her for a spin.

It's all for me.
Mmm-hmm.

It's new business.
It's gonna be my business.

Okay.

Logistical support for airports.
That's right.

Okay. And you're
calling it IAC?

What do you know
about business?

You are
a TWA airline pilot.

That's how you
support this family.

This is gonna be
good for us, all right?

What about benefits?

Our healthcare?

We have great
healthcare with TWA.

That's...

You know, I'm sure that's
not gonna be a problem.

And what the hell
does IAC mean, anyway?

Independent
Aviation Consultants.

Well, that sounds
fuckin' made up, Barry.

It does?

Flight controls
free and correct.

Warning and
enunciator lights.

Check on that.

Anti-skid lights.
That's off.

Landing gear. Handle's down.
Three green.

Speed brake lever.

Stowed.

Thrust levers.
Cut off.

Engine start levers.
Cut off.

Slap trim cut-off switches.
Normal.

Fire warning system?

Check.

Radius
transponder radar?

Barry?
Radius transponder radar?

Yeah. Check, check.

Rudder, aileron trim?

Zero, zero.

Windows?

Closed.

Flight attendant briefing?

Yeah.

Barry?

You're gonna be
all right, Jimmy.

Where are you...
Where are you going?

Barry! Barry,
where are you going?

Shit! I know, I know.

That was bold.

That was bold.

I do tend to leap
before I look.

Maybe, uh...

Maybe I should have asked
a few more questions.

Anyway, it was back
in '78 and, uh...

It was September? October.

Anyway, it, uh...

That was the day
I joined the CIA.

Now, in those days,
the Cold War was in full swing.

The Soviets were backing
communist insurgents

all over Central America.

And the CIA wanted snaps of them
insurgents.

Now, these
pictures are sensational.

Who's responsible?

They're mine.

Hey, Monty?

Yeah.

Go fuck yourself.

Whoa!

Oh, shit!

Come on, now.
Come on, now.

Fuck!

Whoo!

The people's choice.

So, uh...
So then I show him this one.

And he goes, "God damn it, Schafer,
I didn't ask for mug shots."

I mean, they say
they're the best

reconnaissance photos
they have ever seen.

Does this mean
I get a raise?

You're doing great.

Hey, you got
a family, Schafer?

Big push!

Motherfucker!

Wife? Kids?

See, I, uh...

I didn't tell Lucy I ain't
working for TWA no more.

You're serving
your country.

I am gonna need some more
money at some point.

You'll figure it out.

Oh. Uh...

We, uh...

We're sending you
to Panama tomorrow.

The CIA was so
happy with my work,

they gave me another job.

Bagman.

See, there was this colonel
down in Panama

named Noriega.

And he was selling the agency's Intel
on all the commies down there.

For your friends.

My job was just
to drop off and pick up.

Just drop off

and pick up.

Right here in Baton Rouge.

You're listening to
the best Louisiana music.

Hey, Luce,
pancakes are up.

Thanks, baby.

Hola.

In the car.

Hey, uh...

A dónde vamos, fellas?

Welcome.

Come on up.

Thank you for
coming to see me.

Sir, I... I think there's been some
sort of mistake here, because I...

These fellas just picked me
up at the airport, and...

No, no. No mistake.
Just, please, have a seat.

Coffee, Mr. Seal?

You know my name?

You're the gringo who flies
to Central America every week

taking pictures very low
with your fancy plane.

Oh, yeah, I mean, uh,

those photos...
See, I have a, uh...

Aviation company here
in South America that I...

Yes. Yes, the AIC.

IAC. Yes, sir.

Or is it CIA?

What?

No...

No, no, no.
I'm just a businessman here.

I'm a businessman.

Imports, exports,
cattle, horses.

But now...

Now, God above has blessed this great
country with new riches, Mr. Seal.

And you could help us.

How's that?

You know the routes,

you can get in and out of Estados Unidos
with your fancy plane.

What... What kind of riches
are we talking about here?

Cocaine, Mr. Seal!

We had a few
difficulties

getting our exports to
your country, Mr. Seal.

Nine-nine-nine-six.

Ma'am, what's in the bag?

We decided
to try new ideas.

We want you to take off from
here, fly directly to Miami.

We'll pay you
$2,000 per kilo.

How much is a kilo?

2.2 pounds,
Mr. Seal.

$2,000

every 2.2 pounds.

I... I'm sorry, fellas.

I didn't catch
y'all's names.

Jorge Ochoa.

Carlos Lehder.

Pablo Escobar.

A couple of billion dollars
from now,

they'd be known as
the Medellín Cartel.

Back then, they were
just three businessmen

trying to figure out
how to get

their merchandise
to the United States.

There was just
one small problem.

See, pilots, they were killing themselves
trying to get off that runway.

I see you had a few other boys
try to make it outta here.

Sí, sí.

Terrible pilots.

Yeah, well,

I'm sure they
were heavy, you know,

carrying a lot of fuel to
make it to the States,

and merchandise, and...

Yeah, you know,
this airport, I mean,

it's high altitude
and a short runway.

And, I mean, shit, you got trees
and mountains on both sides.

Is there, uh...

Is there somewhere else
I could take off from?

Nowhere the Army
wouldn't notice.

Well, uh...

Can you make
the runway longer?

They say
I should get rid of you.

That you can't do it.

- We have our people in Miami.
- Yeah.

You're gonna land at the Okeechobee
airport between 2:00 and 6:00 a.m.

Look, there's, uh...

There's been
a change of plans,

'cause I ain't
landing in Miami in...

Thank you. Gracias.

See, I ain't landing
anywhere with this stuff.

That's... That's how
y'all got in trouble.

Now, look,
just hear me out.

I know Louisiana.
Now, here's a map.

Now, I'm gonna drop this stuff
right where "X" marks the spot.

All right?
Just...

What do you mean, you're
not gonna land, huevón?

Okay. Now, just...

Hey. Come here.

Look... Just look at this.

Look.

See right here?

See that there?

Hmm.

Right there is your
million-dollar door.

All right. You just
go around. Each side.

But tight.

No, no, no.
No more.

I said no more.

But there's
plenty of room, gringo.

No, no, no.

Guys, guys, it ain't about room, all right?
It's about weight.

Now, we agreed on 200,
I even put on 300.

No, no, no.

Keep pushing. Come on.
Need all the runway I can get.

Keep going. Keep going.

Hold! Hold!

Bien. Bien.

Gracias, gracias.

Oh, whoa.

Where the hell do you think
you're going, big fella?

Come on. Out.

He's gonna guard
our product.

This guy's fatter than fuck.

I'm already 1,500
pounds overweight.

Either I fly the big fella
or I fly your product.

Good luck, hermano.

Christ will
keep you safe.

He ain't gonna make
this runway any longer.

Hey, Jorge.
Come here, give me that.

Come on.

Come on, come on, come on.

Come on!

Oh, Jesus!

Whoo!

I've got a possible target headed
due north 25 miles offshore.

That's platform 14.
One of Shell's helicopters.

You can disregard.

Cheers! Cheers!

Barry.

Wow.

For you.

Was that,
uh, Wednesday?

You want me to go... He wants
me to go again on Wednesday?

Yes. Next Wednesday.

Well, what about
the, uh, that runway?

Pablo! Jorge!

Oh... Whoa!

Wait here,
Barry. Wait here.

Are we running?

What...

What is that?
You want me to wait here?

Pablo?

Oh, God.

Don't shoot!

No, no, no.

Sí, sí, sí, sí, sí.

Barry?

Barry Seal.

Schafer?

Barry Seal?
Schafer?

Yeah. No, no, no.
Oh, my God!

You look terrible.

It is so good to see you.

You missing a tooth?
Yeah.

What the fuck?

See these fellas
right here?

Yeah.

I think they
know that I am CIA.

You're not CIA.

You're a drug
smuggler, Barry.

Listen.

Louisiana PD was notified
of your arrest here.

They're gonna raid
your house at 6:00 a.m.

They're gonna pick up Lucy,
bring her in for questioning.

Maybe even keep
her overnight.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.
You gotta get me out of here.

Well, maybe...

Maybe we could
figure something out.

Okay, you can...
You can stop now if you want.

'Cause, believe me,

shit gets crazy from here.

Do you remember
them fellas that

I told you I was
taking snaps of?

Turns out they was
a bunch of commies.

Called themselves Sandinistas.

These fellas managed
to get their shit together

and take control right here in this
little country called Nicaragua.

Oh, no, that's El Salvador.

Here you go. Nicaragua.

Theirs is the first successful
revolution in Central America.

Now, that may have been
bad news for some people,

but not for me.

See, there was
a new sheriff in town.

My fellow Americans,
I must speak to you tonight

about a mounting danger
in Central America.

Even after
everything that happened, I...

I still love Ronnie Reagan.

I mean,
any man that can make it

from that monkey movie

all the way to
the White House...

What's the matter with him?

...he's gotta know
what the hell he's doing.

And what he wanted was to kick them
commie Sandinistas out of Nicaragua.

And he wanted the Nicaraguan freedom
fighters, called Contras, to do it.

They need to know
that the U. S. supports them

with more than just pretty
words and good wishes.

But Congress,
well, they smelled

the makings of
another Vietnam,

and they outright refused
to let Ronnie have his war.

But do you think
them politicians

could tell
the Gipper what to do?

Hell no. He turned to the CIA,

and the CIA turned to me.

Schafer? Schafer,
that morning raid

on my family,
that's off now, right?

No, no. That's, uh...
That's still happening.

What?
6:00 a.m.

This fucking country!

Well, hold on, now.
Stop!

Now, we have a deal!

I'm not a cop, Barry.

I can't make a search
warrant go away, you know?

Things are in motion here.

Come on, man. What the
hell am I gonna do?

I suggest you get your
family outta Louisiana.

Well, where am I
supposed to take them?

We got a place for ya.

Mena.

Arkansas.

Arkansas?

Hey.

Hey, Luce.

Mmm. Hey, baby.

Hey, hey, hey.

My God, baby,
what happened to you?

I'm okay.

Barry, you're
missing a tooth.

Hey, uh...

We're moving.

We gotta pack
everything up.

We gotta be outta here
before the sun comes up.

We, uh...

So, we'll get
these dresses and...

Do you, uh...

You need all them shoes?

Well, hey there, sunshine.

How you doing?

Now, look. I'm gonna
give you a plastic bag.

What I want you to do
is you go upstairs

and you put your
favorite toys...

Go on back to bed, honey.
Daddy done lost his mind.

No. Darlin',
you listen to Daddy.

You go do that 'cause we're
going on an adventure.

No, we're not
going on an adventure.

Like the time we went
camping in the parish?

Not actually, but...

'Cause every adventure
is different.

Oh, my God. You're actually
serious right now.

Barry, it's 4:00 a.m.,
I'm not moving.

Christina's school
play is tomorrow.

Hey, do you trust me?

No!

But you love me.
You do love me.

Yeah, of course,
I fucking love you.

Then, listen,
we gotta move.

And we gotta get outta here
before the sun comes up.

Look at that.
They got barbecue.

It's got a lot of charm.

This place has got
a lot of charm.

Plenty. But all
we got's a porta-potty out back.

And I think that'd be cruel
and unusual punishment. Right?

Well, I'll be sure to give 'em a
good what for on Monday, though.

All right?

Thank you.

Front door's open.

It's okay.

That's... That's
an easy fix.

I gotta...

Get in. Come on.

Oh, shit.

We gotta make this quick.

She might leave me
before I get back.

So, this is all yours.

Including everything between
here and your house.

Almost 2,000 acres.

What do you think?

I own all this?

Oh, yeah.

This whole airport?

Yeah. Congratulations.

AK-47s.

Soviet-made for the PLO.

The Israelis captured these and
then secretly traded them to us.

And you're gonna
fly 'em to Nicaragua.

You didn't say
nothing about guns.

It's a war, Barry.

Freedom fighters can't put up much
of a fight if they aren't armed.

This was the deal.

Or would you rather be
in a Colombian prison?

This is every current law
enforcement investigation

on the Gulf Coast.

FBI, ATF, DEA, Customs.

These maps will help
you avoid all of 'em.

Holy shit.

You'd just fly
where they ain't.

Everything in
this hangar's mine?

Oh, yeah.

That truck's mine?
Mmm-hmm.

Tools are mine?

Yes, sir.

This airplane's mine.

Bag is mine.

What bag?

I fed the kids.

They're sleeping.

Unpacked the car.

That's good.

Fixed the sink.
Just a valve.

See? I told you
that was gonna be easy.

Fuck, Barry!

Okay. All right.
All right. Okay.

I'm gonna come clean.

I don't work
for TWA no more.

No shit, Barry.

Are you going to prison?

No, ma'am.

You've gotta take
care of this family.

'Cause I will take the kids.

I will go right back to working
for Kentucky Fried Chicken.

Luce, what I'm
working on, it's...

Barry, I am six
months pregnant.

It's top secret.

I need a fridge.

I need beds
for our children.

I need a stove, a fucking
washing machine...

Washing machine
over there, all right?

Now, let me just...

Is this all legal?

All right. What I'm about
to tell you, you... You...

You gotta swear you can't
ever tell anybody this, Lucy.

All right?

I am working

for the CIA.

Hola.

Howdy, amigos.

I am here on
behalf of Uncle Sam.

Look, Schafer.
I ain't no military expert,

but are you sure
these are the right guys?

'Cause they seemed
a damn sight more

interested in my boots
than in your guns.

Now, look.
This is getting big time.

Schafer, I just don't
think I'm the guy for this.

You just keep delivering
that pizza, hear me?

You just keep delivering.

Hola.

All right.

These are gifts.

All right.

All right? Gifts.

Back off. Off.

Amigos.

Now, these guns are
gifts from Uncle Sam.

I'm not fucking around.

Barry! Put the
bat down, huevón.

We're all friends here.

Jorge.

What the hell
are you doing here?

This is
Don Adolfo Calero.

He works for your government
on the revolution

to bring down the Sandinistas.

Jorge tells me you are the crazy
gringo who always delivers.

We have a new business
proposition to you, Barry.

You bring your American
guns to Colombia,

deliver our cocaine here,
to the Contras,

the Contras take it by
fishing boats to Miami,

and everybody's happy.

It's for the war effort,
Mr. Seal.

Turns out, the Contras
didn't really want to fight a war.

They just wanted
to make money.

Like the rest of us.

Meanwhile, the Medellín
Cartel wanted guns.

So they worked out a little trade.
What was I gonna tell 'em?

I'm just a gringo
who always delivers.

Here's how
the operation worked.

I'd load up with guns in Mena,

then, using Schafer's Intel,
I'd bypass any law enforcement

and fly straight to the
cartel's airstrip in Medellín.

The Colombians,
well, they loved them guns.

And I'd load up
with fresh powder

and fly on to
the Contra training camp.

The Contras hid the coke in fishing
boats and sailed it up to Miami.

Meanwhile, I'd get
another load of powder,

take it back to the States with a
quick stop to refuel in Panama

under the protection of my
old friend, Colonel Noriega.

Congratulations on
your promotion, General.

'Course,
he'd get his cut, too.

On the way back, I'd keep
an eye out for the DEA

and then I'd dump it all
in the swamps of Louisiana.

The operation got so big

I had to get some help.

Pete Dubois manufactured guns
until he discovered

he had a knack
for selling pot.

Stan Mason flew dope
from Mexico to Arizona.

Bill Cooper. He flew opium all around
Southeast Asia during Vietnam.

Then there's Bob. Uh...

I don't know much about Bob.
Hell of a pilot, though.

I called these boys
my Snowbirds,

and we could fly
through anything.

Schafer!

Barry.

How's it going?

Hey, boss!

That was fucking crazy,
man! Whoo!

How's it, uh...
How's it going down there?

Oh, you know...

Busy.

You?

Oh, yeah.

Busy.

Where are
they going?

We need to borrow
some of your land.

They want you to
fly 'em up here

to train.

For training.

Who?

The Contras.

You... You want me
to bring 'em up here?

To Mena?

We're setting up a field and
operational training ground.

Where? On...

On my land?
Yeah.

Starting immediately.

Which is great.

Is that a problem?

No.

Hey.

Whatever you need, boss.

Hang on!
We're supposed to have 15.

I'm only counting 12 here.

Them Contras were damn excited
about being in the U. S. of A.

And they were running away almost
faster than we could bring 'em in.

Hey, you two!
Where you think you're going?

Wow. You wanna quadruple
the shipments?

We're confident the
Contras can win by summer

if we give 'em
what they need.

That's great.

How much more can you
get out of your guy in Mena?

Oh, we'll get
everything out of him.

That's what
I like to hear.

We're expanding
operations, Barry.

Come on, now.
One at a time!

Just one at a time!
Hey, hold on! Hold on!

No, no, no.

We'll take care of everybody.

Back!
Hands off!

Please. Back!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Everyone just
calm the fuck down!

Salud.

Hey, Barry.

Yeah?

You think those
Contras can win?

No.

Eh...

Hi.

This just came.
"Go Razorbacks. Barry."

Season tickets.

Fifty-yard line.

Well, that was
awful nice of him.

How much property has Seal
bought up since he came to town?

I don't know, 500 acres?

2,000 acres. From the
airport to Ouachita.

What's he want with
all that worthless land?

It's... It's really none
of our business, really.

He's good people, Judy.

He's doing a lot
for the community.

I'd like to open
a bank account.

Oh. Bless you!

I'll be right back.

David!

Come on, Christina!

Good job, guys, good job!
Whoo!

Whoo!

Way to go, Christina!
Go, go, go!

Oranges.
You guys want some oranges?

Hey, guys, I got pizza!

- You guys want some pizza?
- Yeah!

Here you go! All right.
Let me just put this right...

There you go.

Nice wheels!
Oh, you like her?

I do.

1982.

All the bells and whistles.

First one in the state of
Arkansas, and she's yours.

She's mine?

She's yours.

Oh, my God, Barry!

Thank you!

Wow. A little something
extra in there.

Fuck me, Barry!

What?

Okay. You need to behave.

I brought some snacks
out for you, Christina.

By the summer of '82,

business was a-boomin'.

Got us at Tuesday, three o'clock.
Tuesday at three o'clock.

We need
to increase the shipments.

Can you add
a Friday delivery?

Friday? Okay. Hold on, now.

Yeah?

We wanna double the amount
of guns we're bringing in.

Double?

Next batch by Friday.

Oh, hold on.
Does it have to be Friday?

I opened a few
front corporations.

I can't wait to learn
everything there is to know

about the sign business,
Mr. Seal.

Me, too.

I spent 30 years working
the pumps at Gas N' Sip.

Well, sir, I think it's about time
you moved to upper management.

But the money was coming in
faster than I could launder it.

I was taking pictures,
delivering guns,

dropping off and picking up.

Damn,
I was building an air force.

New toy, boys!

- I wanted to get new books.
- You did?

What're you doing? Barry!

Smile, Barry.

Jorge!

Lobsters!
Oh, you remembered!

What'd I tell you? You think
I'm gonna forget that?

Your husband
is a genius.

Well, it absolutely, positively
has to be delivered overnight.

Esposa, Lucy.

No, no, no.
Sí, sí, sí.

I had my fingers
in every pie on the rack.

10 million in Mena National,

12 million in Mena State,

15 in Mena Trust.

I had 40 parked in Miami,

20 in Panama,
7 million in lawn bags,

8 in Samsonites, 4 buried in
the woods behind my house,

and 90 pounds of gold
in my closet.

Hot damn!

Oh, honey, watch the yoke.

If this ain't the greatest
country in the world.

Ah!

Uh...

JB.

Uh...

Yeah.

Hey, sis!
JB!

What the fuck?

Look at you!

Look at you!
God damn!

Get in here.

Look at this fucking house!

Parking a Chevy's a lot harder
than it fucking looks, Luce.

Hey! Watch your mouth
around the kids.

Sorry.

That right?

Yeah, man.

They had me
cramming those S-10s

into every goddamn inch
of the fucking...

Hey, you heard me!

I'm sorry!

Look, thing is
is that the cars

were so close to
each other, right?

You couldn't help but
scratch, right? Yeah.

Then they would
take the scratches

out of my
fucking paycheck, man!

- Hey! JB!
- Sorry.

Well, I don't know how
you handle the pressure, JB.

You're staying here,
you're getting a job.

Or, you know, I could just
give you some folding cash,

you go and do
what you want.

- Don't you look at him like that.
- What?

You are getting a job,
JB, not a handout.

My brother's
getting a job, Barry.

You're getting a job.

Definitely.

Well, you hear that?
That's the law.

You're gonna
have to work, son.

Gonna have to work.
That's right.

What is it I'll
be doing, exactly?

Yo, Barry!

Hey, Barry.

Barry!

What now, JB?

So this is a big hangar,
and I'm tired of sweeping.

You can take a break
when you get it done.

Let's go.
Get it done!

Hey, man, I got
a new job for you.

Get me a beer, man.

Dead soldier.

Here's your fucking...

Barry?

Yeah?

Roscoe dug this up
in the backyard.

There are bills
blowing around everywhere.

I'll rake it up
in the morning.

I found three more of 'em
up in the fireplace.

Shit.

We had cash flooding in
from every direction.

Who... Who thought that was
gonna be a problem? I mean...

We were running out
of places to put it.

Easy. Whoa.

Don't get behind 'em.
These are dangerous animals.

No, maybe you
should call the trainer.

No, honey, I got this.

Come on, now.

Hang on.

What you
think of that?

Holy shit!

JB got a new car.

Did you give
that boy a raise?

Hey, Barry, Luce!

What in the holy fuck?

That girl is 15.

It's huge!
I told you it was huge!

You actually live here?
Uh-huh.

Hey! Can I talk to
you for a second?

Yeah.

What?
Come here.

What the hell, JB?

What?

I haven't done
nothing yet!

JB. Come on.
Hi, Miss Seal.

Hi.

What... We were just
gonna go for a swim.

Come here.

Please don't tell my
mama that I was here.

Come on, honey.
Let's go inside.

Where'd you get
the money for this car?

I'm gonna be honest with you,
Barry, 'cause I can't lie to you.

I stole it from
the hangar.

All right.

I opened up one of
the Samsonites.

I found so much fucking
money in there, man.

JB, JB, JB.
So much goddamn money.

JB, you can't do that.

You can't do that.

500 down 300.

Watch out for
that tree at the end.

Yeah, I remember that.

No, Pete,
you gotta turn that off.

I can't see nothing
with it on.

Gotcha.

75. 50.

Oh. Nicely done, boss.

You boys
see this?

Oh! Fuck!

This is the United
States Drug Enforcement Administration.

You are in violation of the Air
Defense Identification Zone.

We are ordering you
to land immediately.

Follow us to
New Orleans NAS.

All right, boys.
It's gonna be a long night.

Let's go back out to sea,
105 knots.

Get them
flaps down.

I repeat, we are ordering
you to land immediately.

The DEA was using these fancy
new jets that we couldn't outrun.

Follow us to
New Orleans NAS.

But all that speed
comes at a heavy price.

I repeat...

They could go fast,

but we could go slow.

For a long time.

Low fuel. Low fuel.

We gotta turn around, guys.
We're bingo.

Those pricks are
right fucking there.

All right, boys.

DEA finally ran out of gas.
Time to head home.

Bill! The fuck, man?

Where you headed, buddy?
Come on.

All right, I'll get him.
I'll get him.

Bill? Come on, turn around.
Come on, let's go.

Bill? You hear me?

Oh, son of a bitch!

Bill's asleep.

God damn!

Bill, wake...
Wake up, man!

That motherfucker
can sleep anywhere.

Wake up, Bill.

Bill!

Morning, Bill!

Okay, I'm up, I'm up.

Welcome back.

Those bank financials
that you asked for.

Yeah.

There's a lot of money
in Mena, Arkansas.

Thanks.

I think you're gonna appreciate
what we've done here, Barry.

You're making me
my own vault?

Oh, no, no. We're using this auxiliary
for all our other customers.

We gave you
the main vault.

How 'bout that!

Aerostar 2-1-9-3-golf.

Head for New Orleans
Naval Air Station at once.

Yeah. Come on,
come on, come on!

You better run,
you prick.

This is the
United States Border Patrol.

Shit.

We are ordering
you to land.

Hey, boys.

I see you finally got smart
and got a slower plane.

Two of 'em.

That's right, son.

We up here as
long as you want.

Aerostar, we are ordering you
to land immediately.

Ha. All right,
motherfuckers. Let's land.

I repeat, we are
ordering you to land...

What the fuck?

Stay on him.

Shit!

Oh, shit!

Is this your yard?

All right. Well,
that's for the damage.

And, uh, here's a little
something extra for your sister.

Hey, little darlin'.

And your bike.

All right.

You never saw me.

"A plane crashed
in Louisiana

"with 200 kilos of
Colombian powder."

Two hundred.

Right.
Is that your boy?

I'm sorry, are you working
for the fucking DEA now?

Interesting read.

I got it.

Hello, amigo.
Sí.

We had to get out of Colombia
in the middle of the night.

I wasn't the only one
having trouble with the DEA.

Escobar's gone crazy and
declared war on the government.

Thanks to Pablo Escobar's
unique management style,

the cartel found themselves
kicked out of Colombia.

The only place
the DEA couldn't touch him?

That's right. Nicaragua.

We're going to
meet Señor Vaughan.

He's the Minister
of Interiors.

He controls
the airstrips.

It's how we get you in.

Barry, just sit and keep
your mouth shut.

Here's your butter, sir.
Thank you.

You're welcome.

What's up?

How you doing?

Stop running!

Fuck!

- Hey, Luce, you hear me?
- Yes.

Honey? You all right?
Yeah, I can hear you.

Honey, I hate to tell you this right
now, but JB has been arrested.

- That little shit.
- What happened?

I don't know.
Got caught

with a whole lot of money.
That dumb fuck.

Honey... What do you
want me to do here, babe?

There ain't nothing
to do, really. Uh...

I'm just in a meeting. And we'll
go over that when I get home.

All right?
I'll take care of that.

All right.
Hurry, Barry.

All right? You just
sit tight. I love you.

Okay.

How much?

That's 15...

1,500 kilos, Barry.

1,500?
Sí.

In one go.

In one go?

Sí.

Well, we ain't never
done that before. That's...

Sanctuary isn't cheap.

That's a lot.

Can you do it?

Yeah. I'm gonna...
Yeah. I'm gonna get home.

Right now. I'm gonna leave,
and then we'll figure it out.

I'll figure it out.

Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

Get it fucking done!

Fucking lawyer
doesn't know shit.

I got two fucking priors, man,
and he doesn't understand.

No, no, no.
He does understand.

And you gotta do what he tells you to do.

No, he doesn't, man.

One more strike, man, one more
strike and I could go to prison

for life, man.
JB?

JB, just hold on.

Barry? Barry,
are you there?

Daddy!

Hey, darlin'.

What's that? Hold on.

- Yeah?
- Barry.

We've been trying
to get a hold of you, amigo.

Yeah, I know that, amigo.

Listen, could you hold on?
I'll be right back.

- JB?
- Yeah.

There's some people
that wanna talk to me.

No, no, no. You don't talk
to anyone about anything.

Now, you do what that
lawyer tells you to,

and you keep your
fuckin' mouth shut.

I'm taking care of this.

Okay.

Listen, Jorge.

We gotta put on
the brakes for a bit.

Brakes? No, no, no.
No brakes.

We have product to move.

I understand, amigo.
But I got a family situation.

Your brother-in-law?
We know all about it.

We'll handle it, amigo.

No, no, no. I don't
want you to handle it.

Barry, listen.

I got it. I got this.
Barry.

Listen to me.
We'll handle it. Okay?

No, no, no. Jorge.
So, don't worry.

Jorge... Jorge...
We'll talk business later.

I don't want to
see Daddy no more.

Barry, they don't know about
all them suitcases you got

or what you got
in them planes.

The guns you got.
They don't know anything about it.

We're good, man.

I can't fix this,
you hear?

They're gonna give you
10 years for not talking.

That's 10 years people
gotta worry you will.

But I didn't
say anything, man!

You can talk to
the goddamn lawyer.

Where we going, man?

Jesus Christ!
I'm fuckin' family.

We're family!

That's right.

We're family.

What's this?

Inside's a passport, first-class
ticket to Bora Bora,

and enough cash...

Enough cash to make a damn
good life for yourself.

Now, you're gonna
get in that car

and you're gonna drive straight
to Dallas/Fort Worth airport.

And nowhere else.

You don't even stop to take a piss.
You hear me?

Yeah, I hear you.

Good luck, kid.

I'll tell you
what, Barry.

I'm gonna send you a goddamn address.
Okay, Barry?

You're gonna start sending me
cash on the fucking regular.

You understand?
You hear me?

Fuckin' goddamn fuckin' dick,
all high-and-mighty.

Piece of shit.

Oh, and Barry,

fuck you, man!
Fuck you and my cunt sister.

Excuse me?
Did you just...

Hey! Hey!

Money every
week, asshole!

What the fuck?

What? Oh, shit.

Hey! Hey. Barry.

Oh, my God.

Barry. Barry!

What do you need, Bill?
What do you need? What do you need?

Hey, man... Man,

I'm, like, freaking out, man.
What is going on with JB?

Huh?

Don't worry about JB.

What if he talks, man?

He ain't gonna.

Yeah, but what
if he does?

He ain't gonna
talk, Bill.

How do you know?

I am fucking positive.

Okay, man.

Good. I'm gonna trust
you on this one, man.

Good.

In the calendar year, your
operations have transported

10,500 Russian AKs
to the Contras.

Yeah.
5,000 of which

have found themselves in the
hands of the Colombian cartel.

Right. But...

Out of the 916 Contras brought
into the United States to train,

only half made it
back to Nicaragua.

Half is... The other
half are in the wild.

What's going on here?

Oh, yeah. We had to
send the Contras home.

Home?
Yeah.

They weren't fighting.

That's the reality
of that situation.

You know, it didn't help
that their guns were in Colombia.

Did it, Barry?

So...

What now?

We'll call ya.

Call me?

Schafer?

Hey, Schafer!

Who the fuck's Schafer?

Okay, everybody, you know the drill.
Everybody gets a burn bag.

Into it, you put anything with
Barry Seal's face or name on it.

Come on, boys.
We gotta move.

We gotta get all
this stuff out of here.

- Pete.
- What? Everything?

Come on, boys, let's go.
We gotta move this out.

Let's go! Let's go!

Into the burn bag. Go!

Purchase orders.
Aircraft invoices.

Be a team here.
Let's move it out.

Holy shit, man.

Look at all these guns.
We gotta move all of it.

Where we supposed to
put all of this stuff?

Just get it off
my property.

Anything with
the word "Mena."

Fuel bills, memos, names,
directives, photos.

Anything like that.

Anything which can link us with him,
you put it in the burn bag.

And what do you do with it?

Burn it.
You burn it.

Bob, need
a little help back here.

In the back!

Give me
a hand with this shit.

Got it.

Seal! DEA!

Back away from the truck
with your hands in the air.

Drop the
fucking box, shithead!

Show us your hands!
Drop the fucking box!

Nice and high!

ATF!

Drop your weapons!

Whoa, whoa, whoa! DEA!
Lower your guns!

ATF! Put your guns down!

Stand down!

It's cool!

Everybody's friends here.
DEA, all right?

- This is our collar.
- Bullshit!

No, no, no.

State Police!

What the fuck are
y'all doing in my county?

Nobody move!

FBI!

Ah, fuck.

Well, hey, boys,
how about my phone call?

We're sorry.

You have reached
a number that has been

disconnected or is
no longer in service.

Oh, shit.

If you feel you have reached
this recording in error,

please check the number and try...
Come on, Seal.

You know who I am,
Mr. Seal?

No, ma'am.

I'm Dana Sibota,
state attorney general.

You've got DEA, ATF, FBI, all
wanting their pound of flesh.

Yes, ma'am. It's...
It's quite a room.

Yeah. Well, you hit
the trifecta, didn't you?

I mean, guns, drugs,
money laundering.

And the state of Arkansas is gonna
rip the bark right off of you, boy.

We are gonna put you in a four-by-six
cell for the rest of your life.

Ma'am, that's a long time.

Yeah.

Miss Sibota, I
have Governor Clinton on the line.

He says it's urgent.

It's the Governor.

It's your governor.

Put him through. Clear the room.
Take him with you.

Yeah?

What do you need, Bill?

Did y'all know

that Caddies have
more trunk space

than any other car
in the world?

I'll give each and
every one of you a Caddy.

Huh?

You'd do that
for all of us?

Yes, sir. I would.

I'd get all y'all Caddies.
Have 'em here this afternoon.

What are you trying to do, Seal?
Add another 20 for bribery?

Oh, no, no, no.

I'm just offering y'all
Caddies for your troubles.

What troubles,
Seal, hmm?

Well, bringing me down here, for one.
You see,

I'm gonna walk out of here.

I'm gonna walk out of here.

And there ain't a damn thing any
one of you can do about it.

All right.

Do it.

Wait. Wait... Wait a minute.
No, no.

No, he's free to go, boys.
What the fuck?

What the hell do you mean,
"He's free to go"?

You want to explain
what's going on here?

- He's free to go.
- Free to go?

You boys should've
taken the Caddies.

I'll be seeing you, Seal.

Ma'am.

I tell you,

it is good to see you boys,
I ain't gonna lie.

But I figured you'd
have to show up, see?

'Cause I just
know too much.

Schafer sent you, right?

Who the fuck
is Schafer?

All right,
all right now.

Seriously, fellas,
who are you?

Usually, I talk
with you from my office

in the West Wing
of the White House,

but tonight, there's something
special to talk about.

And I've asked someone
very special to join me.

Are we going...

Nancy.

Not long ago, I was asked
by a group of children

what to do if they
were offered drugs.

And I answered,
"Just say no."

Drug criminals are ingenious.

So we must be smarter and stronger
and tougher than they are.

Say yes to your life.

And when it comes
to drugs and alcohol,

just say no.

You a pilot?

I've been known
to fly some.

Me, too.

Air National Guard.

'68, '69.
Oh.

Junior?

Well,

I'll see
you around, flyboy.

All right.

The Sandinistas are burning the
American flag in the streets.

Please. There is no deal if
we don't get the Sandinistas.

Then there's no deal.
Horseshit.

There's no deal
unless we get Medellín.

Now, you may be wondering why
my ass wasn't in jail at this point.

This is disgusting!

But I gotta be honest.
Frankly, so was I.

- Ollie...
- Oh, please!

This fella here
is with the DEA.

And this fella here is a
colonel named Ollie North.

Reagan's go-to guy.

The DEA just wants to nail the
Medellín Cartel once and for all.

Now, at the same time,
Colonel North wants to prove

the commies in Central America
are involved in the drug trade.

Let me say that again.

This is disgusting!

Colonel North wants to prove
the commies are dealing drugs.

And why am I in the room?

'Cause I'm the gringo
who always delivers.

So, you want me
to keep going?

For your country.

We're gonna bring
these guys down.

And you're
gonna be a hero.

All right, then.

They put me right
back in business.

Now, I'm working
for the White House.

All right,
you have three cameras.

Fifty picture loads each.

You have one here in a bag.

The sightline goes
straight down the back

to where those
gentlemen are now.

You have two more cameras
above each door.

Sightlines directly
in front of the door.

Each camera has a cord.

You just press this
button to take a picture.

That's it.

Let's go.

I can see
the cords, Barry.

Yeah.

I can see this damn cord, which
means they gonna be able to see it.

We'll hide it.

I'm not a photographer.

Your thumb work?
Yeah.

Well, you just
push the button.

When am I supposed
to push the button?

When the guys are standing
here holding the powder.

You know what?
Fuck it, Pete.

I'll take the pictures.

Fuck!

Listen. What's gonna
happen with these photos?

Who exactly is going
to be looking at 'em?

These photos are gonna be
on a need-to-know basis.

Need-to-know.

They're gonna be classified
at the highest levels, Barry.

Daddy! Daddy!

Classified.
Daddy!

We do recognize
the dangers involved here.

No, you don't.

Well, you could always
tell us to fuck off

and spend the next
30 years in Leavenworth.

Come on, boss!

Let's get this over with!

We'll see ya, Rangel.

Smile, Barry!

Bye, Daddy!

Shit! There's
a fucking army out there.

They're gonna
torture us.

Pull our tongues
out through our necks.

That ain't
helping, Pete.

They're gonna cut us up in little
pieces and feed us to the pigs.

I don't wanna be
fed to no pigs, Barry.

Gotta keep our shit
together. Hola!

We're gonna get the yayo,

take these damn pictures,
then get the hell out of here.

Let's keep our shit together.

No, no, no.

Amigos...

They're going to hear
that goddamn camera, Barry.

Amigos.

Escobar. Ochoa.

Hey, hola.

Amigo... Qué pasó?

Hey, Jorge!

Jorge. Fuck!

Come on, man.

A little help.

Shoot the gringos.

What?

Shoot the gringos!

What's that?

Shoot the gringos!
Shoot the gringos!

No, no, no!

You fucker.

- Ochoa!
- Señor.

Pete, stand the fuck up.

They are shaking.
You're shaking.

Look at this!

He pissed himself, man.

You got me.
That was a good one.

That was a good one.

I saved your life, Barry.

I saved your life, eh?
Yes, you did.

Remember that.
Yeah.

Remember.
Crazy gringo.

Come here, Barry.

Hey, Jorge.

Now, let's go
say hi to Pablo.

Pablo's here.

Sí, he's paranoid,
amigo. On edge.

Thinks everyone
is out to get him.

Hola! Pablo!

Let's do this.

What?

Everything good?

I'm here.

I'm here.

And I brought your Harleys.

We're still friends?

That was a good one
that you pulled right there.

You really got me.

Hey, you know, I'm gonna
have to get you back.

Jorge,

look at this, my friend.

Say cheese,
motherfuckers.

We're gonna
make history.

- Barry Seal!
- Yeah!

Barry Seal!
He's a goddamn genius.

There seems to be no crime to which
the Sandinistas will not stoop.

This is
an outlaw regime.

The Sandinistas have even
involved themselves

in the international
drug trade.

I know every
American parent concerned

about the drug problem
will be outraged

to learn that top Nicaraguan
government officials

are deeply involved
in drug trafficking.

This picture, secretly taken at a
military airfield outside Managua

shows Federico Vaughan,

a top aide to one of the nine
comandantes who rule Nicaragua...

Fuck!

...loading an aircraft with illegal
narcotics bound for the United States.

Those motherfuckers!

That's your
fucking face, Barry!

This is an outlaw regime.

Oh, my God!

He betrayed us!

Pablo, we have to take
care of this immediately.

That son of a bitch.
I'm going to rip his head off!

I am truly sorry, Barry.

North jumped the gun.

Yeah, well,
you boys fucked me good.

We all got fucked.

Those photos weren't
supposed to be released,

and certainly not until we had
the Colombians in custody.

Yeah, well, they ain't gonna
be coming for you.

Barry, you knew the risks
when you took those pictures.

You knew what
you were doing.

Barry?

Barry, you there?

Let's go get
some ice cream.

The Feds, they're gonna
try to take everything.

When they come,

you gotta put on
all your jewelry.

All right? All your rings,
you know, your bracelets.

Necklace.

'Cause if you're wearing it,
they can't take it away from you.

You understand?

All right, that's insurance
for you and the kids.

All right?

I understand.

All right. And don't forget
that it's gonna be all right.

It's gonna be all right.
I love you.

I love you.

Sure enough, they came.

And they took it all.

Hey, Luce, honey,

I was thinking

that you might like
to move back to Baton Rouge.

You ain't gonna find
nothing in those drawers.

Try the hat boxes,
third shelf up.

I mean, you
loved it there.

What about you?

I mean, I'm...

Me, uh...

Listen, you see...

Look, if I run,
they're, uh,

they're gonna come for you
and the kids, I mean,

that's how
a thing like this goes,

but, Baton Rouge,
you're safe.

No.

No, I ain't
going nowhere.

We're a family and
we're staying together.

I know. But...

No, sir.
I ain't doing this.

Listen, Luce. Luce.
No.

No, no. Honey, hang on.
Don't do this now.

- No, sir, sir! I'm sorry.
- You know what?

No, no, no, sir.
Come on, sir.

Excuse me,
she's wearing this now.

Luce, you gotta stop.
Hey, you know, fellas...

Sorry, hey...

Can I just have a moment...
Can I just have a moment with my wife?

It's been a hell of a day.

Okay, Barry.
Yeah.

You got one minute.

All right. Luce?

- Honey, now listen to me.
- Let's give him a minute.

Baby, baby,
listen to me.

All right, folks.
Head on out. Listen to me.

I'm gonna go to prison.

I'm gonna do
just a little time.

And I'm gonna
be fine there,

and we're gonna
work everything out,

but I gotta know
you're gonna be safe.

It's gonna be all right.

You gotta trust me.

I mean, you trust me, right?

Fuck no!

All right.

Luce and the kids finally
did move to Baton Rouge.

How can we
have a war on drugs

when the biggest
enemy of the state

is being protected
by our side?

And that
lady prosecutor...

Why, he never
informed the FBI...

...she never,
ever did give up.

...that any such sting
operation was underway.

Defendant will rise.

Barry Seal.
Your Honor.

You are sentenced to 1,000
hours community service.

Dismissed.

- Oh, that is bullshit.
- Watch yourself, Sibota.

- I'm sorry.
- We are talking about a drug smuggler here

of the highest order.
Uh, community service?

Exhibit D!

Mr. Seal's
planes are classified.

I am sick to fuck...
Sibota!

...of this Mickey Mouse
tap-dancin' bullshit.

Sibota, I will
hold you in contempt.

Sorry. I'm very sorry.

So, I'm walking out
of here. Now.

State of Arkansas
has spoken, Mr. Seal.

Do I have to go?

Goodbye.

Hey, darlin'.

I do tend to leap
before I look.

Maybe, uh...

Maybe I should have asked
a few more questions.

Excuse me, sir, ma'am.

Would y'all mind moving out of the way?
I'm just gonna start my car.

- Yeah.
- What?

I really appreciate
that now.

Honey, just keep walking.
Keep walking.

Thank you.
Just startin' my car.

Uh-huh.

Appreciate it.

I spent every day
in a different motel.

Would y'all mind movin'
outta the way there?

Thank you.

A different motel every day.

It's just for the safety of the children.
Thank you.

But I had to show up to this
Salvation Army halfway house

every evening
at the same time.

Judge's orders.

You here for
community service?

Same time, same place.

Uh, what's your name, sorry?
Louis.

Louis. Barry Seal.

Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you.

Sign in for me.

120 days in a row.

There you go.

Hey, you may wanna
move your truck, too.

Now, them Contras were damn excited
about being in the U. S. of A.

Hey, Barry.

When are you gonna
take me flying, man?

Oh.

Thanks, Barry.

Don't tell 'em
I gave you that.

Day 36.

You know, I guess you could
say I helped build an army,

defend a country,

and create the biggest drug
cartel this world's ever seen.

DEA, CIA, White House.

I mean, it's been
a hell of an adventure.

Yeah. Sometimes a little more
than I bargained for.

But God damn!
Now, you try telling me

that this ain't
the greatest country in the...

We'll handle it
from here, Deputy.

Authorities
believe last night's

machine gun killing
of Barry Seal

was ordered by drug bosses
in Medellín, Colombia.

Iran.

We get the Iranians
to arm the Contras.

'Schafer' got a promotion.

After his release, Pete found God and
became a preacher in rural Alabama.

The other pilots
were never seen again.

The CIA continued to use Barry's
plane to arm the Contras...

Shit! Come on,
you big, fat bitch! Pull up!

...until one was shot down
over Nicaragua.

The ensuing scandal was known
as the Iran-Contra Affair.

Mr. President,
what do you know

about money
going to the Contras?

All I know is

this is just
gonna taste wonderful

and I'm looking forward
to tomorrow.

Vice President Bush, did you
know about the Contra aid or not, sir?

Lucy and the kids
settled back in Louisiana.

Want some sauce
with that?

Okay. Thank you.
