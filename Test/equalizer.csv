action;not afraid of ghosts. or anything else i can see, mr. two c's and two l's. came here to tell you you're not a person of interest. no? just an interesting person, for the time being. that sicilian farmer is lorenzo vitale. spent a decade 
action;on interpol's most wanted list. ran a massive cyber empire. siphoning money from offshore accounts, government agencies, pension funds. seems terrorists were using his farm to smuggle drugs to the mainland. -so i'm off the hook? -for now. i gotta id a cell we didn't 
action;know existed. got a plan? you think i'm new to this? desk job two years. probably your first field tour. you'll be dealing with the locals now. -point is? -they have their own agendas. what they say is not always what they mean. aren't you 
action;just full of tips. why me? the question is: why sicily? why not... elba or sardinia? excuse me? why smuggle drugs into the most secure port in the entire region? -that is a good one. -yeah. i'll circle back to you with the answer when 
action;i'm done. i know you will. then you can answer my question: why me? hi, marshal. how are you? what a pretty girl you are. remember me? how's your head, marshal? does it hurt? don't worry, okay? marshal, listen, i need a favor from you. 
action;i need you to go to the somalis... and ask them for their boats. can you do that? sure, you can do that. you're my message boy now, marshal. bravo, marshal! you like being in other people's business. trying very hard not to be, but 
action;you make it very challenging for me. you should stay out of things that are not your concern. it's bad for you. lord knows i'm allergic to bad things. you know... i believe that everything in life... is about timing. now, unfortunately for you... yours 
action;isn't very good. three weeks ago we wouldn't be having this conversation, but i'm here now. i'm really beginning to like this place... and the people. i'm starting to believe, from the bottom of my heart, that this is where i'm supposed to be. so, 
action;whatever it is that you and your friends do, please do it somewhere else. -you warning me? -i'm preparing you. did you get what he said? he's getting ready. he's fun! is that a timex? no. it's a bulgar-- right there. right there. sit down. 
action;sit! that's the median nerve that i'm compressing. on a scale from one to ten, that's a two. that's a three. you don't want me to go to four. i go to four, you'll shit on yourself. you don't want that. i don't want that. 
action;they don't want that. tell your compadres that they can leave. tell them to beat it. go away! go away, now! it's called "pain compliance." your brain is telling you to do one thing, but your body's telling you something else. now, listen to me. 
action;take the gun out of your waist. put it on the table. slowly. get the van. this fucking american. he meddles. give me the cigarette. what do you want to do, marco? i'm gonna execute that motherfucker. and vincent? fuck vincent. he doesn't tell me

action;train station, yeah. plus bomb parts, sophisticated pieces. that's what their drug money has been funding. where are you? -naples. -get back now. why sicily? -why? -why not elba or sardinia? makes no sense, frank, running drugs through the most secure port in the region. 
action;so you're thinking that the mainland faction took possession in-- in naples. it's the easiest port to slip things through. -i think they're here. -so? {\an8}we find the street dealers, drill down hard on them. -get them to give up their suppliers. -who give up 
action;wholesalers. bottom up. that's good. okay, i'll work down from the dead guys. -if you're right-- -see you at the finish line. ciao. cia appreciates your willing cooperation, chief. we are at your disposal. and what are you doing right now? right now we're gathering

action;and selling them on our own streets to finance your enterprises. you have to do your job. did you see what they did with the money you paid them? did you see how many people died in that train station attack? our people. if i 
action;wasn't buying their drugs... somebody else would have... and the same people would be dead. i'll take care of the woman. you make sure nothing touches me. so you understood nothing. nothing. you're right. i don't give a shit. my brother is dead and you're 
action;here talking about bullshit. without any information. are you stupid? or have you forgotten your place? my place... is head of the police. did you forget who you are? you were a barbarian... and a barbarian you'll always be. i warned you. -where are you 
action;going? -stay here. you must find who killed my brother. piece of shit! understood? shut up! now my barbarians will bring you to the hospital. hurry up and maybe one day you'll wiggle a couple of fingers. did you get my message? next time i'll

action;will reward you! you know who did it. tell me who killed my brother! next time it'll be more than your ear. how many will i kill today? say who killed my brother... or i'll kill your family while you watch. show yourself! it's me 
action;you want. i killed your brother. i asked him: "leave these people alone." he wouldn't listen, so... you're a long way from home... american. i'm where i'm supposed to be. here i am. here i am. you understand what happens now? i understand weakness. i 
action;understand pain. i understand death. i understand suffering. and because of these people, i'm starting to understand peace. you can't take that away from me. god is my witness, you're not gonna take it away from them. so do you understand? that's the question. -i 
action;understand i can take anything i want. -then take me. since you can take anything you want, take me. here i am. here i am. take me. take me. just don't do it here. but this is the best place, american. on these cobblestones. so

action;no one is talking? could be fbi, the cia... interpol... we don't know, vincent. what if it's one of our enemies, one of the other families? we will kill the american. we will kill the american, we will burn that fucking place! tomorrow, simone. tomorrow. 
action;what the fuck? go check. nothing. there's no one there. salvatore? salvatã²! salvat-- simone. antonio? salvatã²? salvatã²? salvatore? antonio? salvatã²! salvatã²! giã². giã²! giã². don't fuck with me! my men... are going to find you... and kill you like a dog. we all have to 
action;face... death. who the fuck are you? it was the blood who are you? you have less than six minutes before the pills stop your heart. who are you? so i know it was the blood for me one day when i was lost marco! 
action;marco! who are you? one day when i was lost in a coordinated effort, {\an8}the cia and interpol have seized enough synthetic amphetamine {\an8}to kill 2.1 million people, more than the population of naples, italy. taking down the local camorra leadership, {\an8}the operation has disrupted 
action;the drug trade, {\an8}cutting funding to a terrorist cell. {\an8}and in a just-breaking story: {\an8}vincent quaranta, alleged head of the camorra's five families, was found dead on a naples street last night from an apparent overdose on the very drug he sold on those streets.

action;to a cyber ghost that no one has been able to find for years... that happens to be a drug-smuggling way station? i didn't know that till i got in there, but yeah. then you snipe your way into a fortified room... with millions of 
action;dollars, bearer bonds, account codes... all you take is 300 grand of dwyer's pension. 366,400. cash. u.s. and it's "dyer." -is this guy some friend of yours? -no. no. gave him a lyft once. i don't understand. you will. -greg dyer? -yeah? i'm emma collins.
