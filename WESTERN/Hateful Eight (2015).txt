Hyah! Huh!

Get in there now!

Get in! Get in!

Get in there, Dude!

Get in now!

Hyah! Come on! Huh!

All right! Huh!

Huh!

Whoa. Whoa.

Whoa.

Got room for one more?

Who the hell are you?!

And what happened to them?

Name's Major Marquis Warren,

former U.S. Cavalry.

Currently a
servant of the court.

Trying to bring a couple
no-goods into market.

Got the paperwork
on 'em in my pocket.

You takin' 'em into Red Rock?

Figure that's where
you headed, right?

I am.

That damn blasted blizzard

has been on our ass
for the last three hours.

There ain't no way we gonna
make it all the way to Red Rock

- 'fore it catches us.
- So you hightailin' it halfway,

to Minnie's Haberdashery?

You know I am.

May I come aboard?

Well, smoke,

if it up to me, yes.

But it ain't up to me.

Who's it up to?

Fella in the wagon.

Fella in the wagon
ain't partial to company?

Fella in the wagon, he
paid for a private trip,

and I'm here to tell you,

he paid a pretty
penny for privacy.

So if you want to go
to Minnie's with us,

you gonna have to talk to him.

Well...

that's what I'll do.

Hold it, black fella.

'Fore you approach, you
take them two guns of yours

and you lay 'em on
that rock over yonder.

Then you raise both your
hands way above your hat.

Then you approach.

Molasses-like.

Real trustin' fella, huh?

Not so much.

Put 'em down.

Come on ahead.

I said way above
your hat, goddamn it!

Now come forward.

That's far enough.

Well, I'll be dogged.

You a black fella I know.

Colonel somethin'-or-other
Warren, right?

Major Marquis Warren.

I know you, too.

We, uh, shared a steak dinner

once upon a time in Chattanooga.

You John Ruth The Hangman.

That'd be me.

How long's that been?

Since that steak?

Oh... eight months.

So why don't you explain to me

what a African
bounty hunter's doin'

wanderin' around in the snow
in the middle of Wyoming?

Trying to get a couple of
bounties in to Red Rock.

So you still in business?

You know I am.

Happened to your horse?

Circumstances caused us to
have to take the long way round.

- My horse couldn't make it.
- Mm.

You don't know nothin'
'bout this filly here.

Nope.

- Don't even know her name?
- Nope.

Well, I guess that makes
this one fortuitous wagon.

I sure as hell hope so.

Major Marquis Warren,
this here's Daisy Domergue.

Domergue, to you
this is Major Warren.

Howdy, nigger.

She's a pepper, ain't she?

Now, girl, don't you
know the darkies don't like

being called niggers no more?

They find it offensive.

I been called worse.

Now, that I can believe.

You never heard of her, huh?

Should I?

Well, she ain't no
John Wilkes Booth,

but maybe you might heard tell

about the price on her head.

- How much?
- $10,000.

Damn.

What'd she do,
kill Lily Langtry?

Not quite.

That ten thousand's
practically in my pocket.

It's why I ain't too anxious
to be handin' out rides,

especially to professionals
open for business.

I can certainly appreciate that.

But I ain't got no
designs on her.

One of my fellas over
there is worth $4,000,

another one's worth $3,000,
and one of 'em's worth $1,000.

That's damn sure
good enough for me.

Well... let me see
their paperwork.

Like I said, molasses-like.

Back off.

Look, I sure hate
to interrupt you all,

but we got a cold damn
blizzard that's hot on our ass

that we're tryin'
to beat to shelter!

I realize that! Now,
shut your mouth

and hold them damn
horses while I think!

Okay, boy, we'll give it a try.

But you leave them two pistols
over yonder with the driver.

Hey, uh, you ain't really
gonna let that nigger

ride in here, is ya?

I mean, maybe up
there with O.B., but...

How ya like the sound
of them bells, bitch?

They real pretty, ain't they?

You open up your
trashy mouth again,

I'll knock out them
front teeth for ya.

You got it?

Yeah.

Let me hear ya say, "I got it."

I got it.

Uh, I'm gonna need a hand
tyin' these fellas up on the roof.

Give O.B. $50 when
we get to Red Rock.

He'll help ya.

Well, I agree with O.B.

This storm got me concerned.

We get goin' a lot quicker
you helped out, too.

Goddamn it to hell, I'm
already regrettin' this.

Now, I can't likely help
you tie fellas to the roof

with my wrist cuffed to hers.

And my wrist is gonna
stay cuffed to hers,

and she ain't never gonna
leave my goddamn side

till I personally put
her in the Red Rock jail!

Now, do you got that?!

Yeah, I got it.

Good.

Get in, Dude!

Hut! Get in!

Go on! Hut!

Come on!

Dude, Coconut, giddyup.

Yah!

♪♪

♪♪

Hut!

Giddyup!

Yah! Cimarron! Leche! Get in!

So, what happened to your horse?

Get in!

He was kinda old.

I done had him for a bit.

When the weather
took a turn for the worse,

well, he done what he
could, but he couldn't make it.

- Get in!
- That's too bad.

Yeah, it is.

Me and ol' Lash done
rode a lot of miles together.

Could say he was my best friend,

if I considered stupid
animals friends, which I don't.

Nevertheless, I'm
gonna miss him.

Leche! Ha!

Who's this Daisy Domergue?

A no damn good
murdering bitch, that's who.

Come on, boys! Get up!

I see you ain't got
mixed emotions

about bringing a
woman to a rope.

By "woman," you mean her?

No, I do not have
mixed emotions.

Get in! Ha!

So you taking her
into Red Rock to hang.

You bet.

You gonna wait
round to watch it?

Oh, you know I am.

- Come on!
- I want to hear her neck snap

with my own two ears.

Get up, boys!

- You never wait to watch 'em hang?
- Get up!

My bounties never hang,

'cause I never
bring 'em in alive.

- Never?
- Never ever.

- Ha! Get up! Yah!
- We talked about this

in Chattanooga. Bringing
desperate men in alive's

a good way to get yourself dead.

- Get in there!
- Can't catch me sleeping

if I don't close my eyes.

I don't want to work that hard.

No one said the job is
supposed to be easy.

No one said it's supposed
to be that hard, neither.

- Get up, boys! Ha!
- But that, little lady,

is why they call
him "The Hangman."

When the handbill
says "dead or alive,"

the rest of us
shoot ya in the back

from up on top of a
perch somewhere,

- bring ya in dead over a saddle.
- Get in!

But when John Ruth
The Hangman catches ya,

you don't die from
no bullet in the back.

Mm-mm.

When The Hangman
catches you, you hang.

Ha!

You overrate him, nigger.

I give ya he got guts, but
in the brains department,

he like a man who took
a high dive in a low well.

Now, Daisy, -

I want us to work out a signal
system of communication.

When I elbow you real hard in
the face, that means "shut up."

You got it?

I got it.

Get in there!

Come on now, boys, get in!

You still got it?

Where?

Right here.

Come on, boys! Get up!

Look, I know you got to
be real careful with it and all,

and I can imagine you
probably don't like taking it

in and out of the
envelope all that often,

- but, uh...
- Get up!

If you wouldn't mind, I'd sure
appreciate seeing that again.

Get in, boys!

Ha! Giddyup!

You're right.

I don't like taking
it in and out

- of the envelope that much.
- I... Yeah.

- But...
- Get in!

Seeing's how you
saved my life and all...

I suppose I could
let you read it again.

Get in! Ha!

Get in there!

Get up now!

Get in!

Giddyup!

Huh!

Get in, now!

Get in!

"Ole Mary Todd's calling, so I
guess it must be time for bed."

Ole Mary Todd.

Ha!

Get in!

- Well, that...
- Get up, boys!

That gets me.

Yeah, it gets me, too.

Get in! Get in!

You know what this
is, tramp? Hmm?

It's a letter from Lincoln.

- Letter from Lincoln to him.
- Get in there!

Yeah.

They shared a
correspondence during the war.

They was pen pals.

- And this is just one of the letters.
- Get up!

What the...

Hyah! - O.B.!

Stop!

Whoa!

Easy.

Whoa.

All the stupid...

Like to rip my goddamn arm off!

I didn't drag her stinking
ass up this goddamn mountain

just for you to break her
neck on the outskirts of town!

You the one handed
her my goddamn letter!

I didn't give it to her,

I give it to you!

That nigger like to bust my jaw.

You ruin that letter of his,

that nigger gonna
stomp your ass to death.

And when he do, I'm gonna
sit back on that wagon wheel,

watch and laugh!

How is it?

Well, she ain't help it none.

But it's all right.

Is that the way niggers
treat their ladies?

You ain't no goddamn lady!

Hey, Mr. Ruth!

What?

There's another fella on
foot up here on the road.

Hey!

What?!

I said there's another fella
on foot, up here on the road.

Hey! Hey!

Considering there's
a blizzard going on,

whole lot of fellas
walking around,

wouldn't you say, Major?

Well, seeing as how
I'm half of them fellas,

uh, yeah, seems
to be a lot of us.

This changes things, son.

$8,000 a lot of
money for a nigger.

With a partner, 18's
a whole lot better.

You really think I'm in
cahoots with that fella, or her?!

Put them on.

Oh, I-I ain't wearing
no handcuffs.

You put those
on, or you can stop

worrying about this
whole thing right now!

Hey!

Hey!

Hand your weapons to the driver.

Little jumpy, ain't you?

Never mind the
jokes. Just do it.

If you say so.

I do.

Okay.

I done done it.

O.B., you got 'em?

I got 'em.

Okay, fella.

You keep holding that
lantern in that one hand,

and you keep that other
hand where I can see it.

Walk over there where I
can get a good look at ya.

Well, I'll be a goddamn
dog in a manger.

Is that you, Chris Mannix?

I'm sorry, friend, do
we know each other?

Not quite.

You know this fella?

Only by reputation.

Like I said, friend, you got
me at a bit of a disadvantage.

Keeping you at a disadvantage

is an advantage
I intend to keep.

Uh, whoever you are,
mister, you sure sound tough

when you talking to a desperate
man knee-deep in snow.

I-I... I don't want no trouble.

I just want a ride.

I-I'm freezing to death!

Who is this joker?

You heard of the rebel
renegade Erskine Mannix?

- Mannix's Marauders?
- That's them.

Scourge of South Carolina,
Mannix's Marauders.

It's Erskine's
youngest boy, Chris.

Brings you in my
path, Chris Mannix?

Well, Mr. Face, I was
riding to Red Rock,

my horse stepped in a
gopher hole in the snow,

fucked up his leg,
had to put 'er down.

You got business in Red Rock?

- Yes, I do.
- What?

I'm the new sheriff.

Horseshit.

- 'Fraid not.
- Where's your star?

Well, I ain't the sheriff yet.

Now, once I get there,
they swear me in.

But, uh, that ain't
happened yet.

And-and that's when
you get your star.

You got anything that
can back any of this up?

Yeah. When we get to Red Rock.

And-and from the look of those
three frozen fuckers up there,

I-I figure you a bounty
hunter open for business.

And-and I figure you taking
them three dead bodies

into Red Rock to get paid?

Three dead.

One alive.

Who's that?

Daisy Domergue.

Who the fuck is Daisy Domergue?

Not a goddamn thing to nobody,
except me and the hangman.

The hangman?

Well, I'll be double-dog damned.

You're "The Hangman" Bob Ruth!

It's John.

And you!

You're the nigger with the head!

Major Marquis!

My Lord, is that
really the real head

of Major Marquis
looking at me now?

Yeah, it's really me,
and it's really my head.

So what's going on?

Uh, y'all having a
bounty hunters' picnic?

Never mind.

Uh, you taking them
three dead bodies

and-and hurrying to Red
Rock to get paid, ain't you?

Yeah.

Well, the man in Red Rock's

supposed to pay you
is me, the new sheriff.

So if y'all want to get paid,

y'all need to get
me to Red Rock.

Well, excuse me for
finding it hard to believe

a town electing you to do
anything except drop dead.

So I'm supposed
to freeze to death

'cause you find
something hard to believe?

No, I suppose not.

Put them on and come inside.

No.

Then you'll freeze.

Then you'll hang.

How so?

Stagecoach driver, could you
come down here and join us?

I got to hold these horses.

I can hear you just
fine from up here.

Well, you just heard
me tell this fella

I'm the new sheriff
of Red Rock, right?

Yeah.

Red Rock is my town now.

And I'm gonna enter my
town in bounty hunter's chains?

No, sir!

Sorry, bushwhackers,

I ain't entering
Red Rock that way.

Now, when you
finally get to Red Rock,

you gonna realize every
goddamn thing I said was right.

And I expect you, O.B.,

to tell the townsfolk
of Red Rock

that John Ruth let their
new sheriff freeze to death.

Ain't no bounty on my
head, bushwhacker.

You let me die, that's murder.

Hold out your hands.

O.B.!

Give the major back his iron.

One thing I know for sure,

this nigger-hating son of a gun

ain't partnered up with you.

Now, I'll help you
protect your 8,000,

you help me protect my ten.

Deal?

Well, ain't love grand?

Y'all want to lie on the ground
and make snow angels together?

Hut!

Come on!

Hyah!

Well, I'll tell you what, Bob.

The name's John.

- When we get to Red
Rock, - O.B.: Hyah!

I'll buy you and
Major Marquis there

- dinner and booze.
- Get in!

My way of saying thanks.

I don't drink with
rebel renegades,

and I damn sure don't
break bread with them.

- Well, Mr. Ruth...
- Get up, boys!

You sound like you got

a axe to grind
against the Cause.

- "The Cause" of a renegade army?
- Get in!

Bunch of losers gone loco.

- You bet I do.
- Get up there! Hyah!

You wrapped yourselves
up in a rebel flag

as an excuse to kill and steal.

And this ought to
interest you, Warren.

In particular,
emancipated blacks.

Sounds like my kind of fella.

Sound to me you been reading

a lot of newspapers
printed in Washington, D.C.

- Get in! Huh!
- Anywho, I'm just trying

to let y'all know
how grateful I am.

I was a goner.

And y'all saved me.

You want to show me
how grateful you are?

- Get in there!
- Shut up.

Goddamn it, Daisy.

It's coming.

Get in there, Cimarron!

Here.

Last piece.

Get in!

Get in, now!

Hyah!

Does he know...

Does he know how
famous you once was?

I don't think so.

Giddyup!

Black Eye.

- Do you know who he is?
- Get in!

Do I know about
the $30,000 reward

the Confederacy put on
the head of Major Marquis?

Come on now, boys!

- Get in!
- Yeah.

Ah, them hillbillies went
nigger head-hunting.

- Get in!
- They just never did get 'em

the right nigger head, did they?

No, they didn't.

But it wasn't
for lack of trying.

Get in, boys! Ha! Get on!

Them peckerwoods left
their homes and families,

and come up this snowy
mountain looking for me and fortune.

Ha! Get up!

Ain't none of 'em found fortune.

The ones you ain't
never heard of no more,

they found me.

Now, it didn't stay $30,000
the length of the war.

Once passions cooled,

it dropped down
to eight, then five.

Get up, boys! Ha!

But I bet even
when it was 5,000,

you had your share of
country boys coming to call.

Mm, you know I did.

Why'd they have a reward on you?

Confederates took exception
to my capacity for killing 'em.

Get up, now!

And after I broke
out of Wellenbeck,

well, the South took
my continued existence

- as a personal affront.
- Get up!

- And the Cause put a reward on my head.
- Hmm.

Get in there!

What's, uh, Wellenbeck?

You ain't never heard

of Wellenbeck prisoner of
war camp, West Virginia?

No, reb, I ain't
never heard of it.

- Hyah!
- Did you bust out?

Oh,

Major Marquis did
more than bust out.

Major Marquis had a bright idea.

Get in, now!

So bright, you got to wonder

why nobody never
thought about it before.

Tell John Ruth your bright idea.

Well, the whole damn place

was just made out of kindling.

Get in!

So I burnt it down.

Get in! Hyah!

There was a rookie regiment
spending overnight in the camp.

47 men burnt to a crisp.

- Southern youth, farmers'
sons, - O.B.: Get up!

Cream of the crop.

And I say, "Let 'em burn."

I'm supposed to apologize
for killing Johnny Reb?

You joined the war to
keep niggers in chains.

I joined the war to kill

- white Southern crackers.
- Ha! Get up!

And that means killing
'em any way I can.

- Get in!
- Shoot 'em, stab 'em,

drown 'em, burn 'em,

drop a big ol'
rock on their head.

Whatever it took to put
white Southern crackers

in the ground, - O.B.: Get up!

That's what I
joined the war to do.

And that's what I did.

To answer your
question, John Ruth,

when Major Marquis
burned 47 men alive,

for no more reason than to
give a nigger a run for the trees,

that's when the
South put a reward

on the head of Major Marquis.

- And I made them trees, Mannix.
- Get in!

You best believe
I ain't looked back

till I crossed the
Northern line.

Oh, but you had a
surprise waiting for you

on the Northern
side, didn't you?

See, once they
started pulling out

all them burnt
bodies at Wellenbeck,

seems not all them
boys were rebs.

Why, you burn up
some of your own boys,

didn't you, Major?

How many burnt prisoners
they end up finding?

Wasn't the final
Yankee death count

something like 37?

Giddyup!

That's the thing
about war, Mannix.

People die.

Oh.

So you gonna chalk it
up to "war is hell," huh?

Well, admittedly, that is a
hard argument to argue with.

But if memory serves,

your side didn't
look at it that way.

I think they thought
37 white men

for one nigger

wasn't so hot a trade.

- I do believe they accused
you - O.B.: Giddyup!

Of being a kill-crazy nigger

who only joined the
war to kill white folks,

and the whole blue
and gray of it all

really didn't matter
that much to you.

Ha! Get up!

And that's why they
drummed your black ass

out of the cavalry with a
yellow stripe down your back.

- Get in!
- Isn't it, Major?

Horseshit!

If he'd have did
all that, the cavalry

- would've shot him.
- Get in!

Well, I didn't say
they could prove it.

- Get up!
- But they sure did

think it out loud,
didn't they, Major?

Hyah! Get up, boys!

But Warren's war
record was stellar,

and that's what saved his ass.

Hyah!

Now, you killed
yourself your share

of redskins in your day,
didn't you, Black Major?

Cavalry tends to
look kindly on that.

I'll tell you what the
cavalry didn't look kindly on.

- Giddyup!
- Mannix's Marauders,

- that's what.
- Get in! Hyah!

And the fact that
Erskine Mannix's little boy

would talk about
anybody else's behavior

during war time makes
me want to horse-laugh.

Hyah!

Don't you say anything
about my daddy.

- What he fought for was dignity
in defeat, -O.B.: Get up there!

And against the
unconditional surrender.

We weren't foreign barbarians
pounding on the city walls.

- Ha!
- We were your brothers.

Get up, now!

We deserved dignity in defeat.

Just how many nigger
towns did y'all sack

in your fight for
dignity in defeat?

Oh, my fair share, Black Major.

- 'Cause when niggers
are scared, -O.B.: Huh!

That's when white
folks are safe.

You gonna talk that
hateful nigger talk,

you can ride up top with O.B.

No.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

You done got
me talking politics.

I didn't want to.

Like I said, y'all, I'm
just happy to be alive.

Get in, now!

Ha! Get up!

I think I'll scoot over
here right by this window,

and let this beautiful
carriage rock me to sleep.

And dream about how lucky I am.

Get up, now!

Ha!

We weren't expecting
another stage tonight!

Yeah, I can see you already
got another one up in here.

Just got through
putting the horses away.

Well, this ain't
the normal line,

but we are stuck on the
wrong side of a blizzard,

so it looks like
you're stuck with us.

Are Minnie and
Sweet Dave inside?

They ain't here.

I'm running the place
while they're gone.

Where's Minnie and Sweet Dave?

He says they ain't here.

He's looking after the
place while they're gone.

Who are you?

I'm Bob.

Well, whoever you are,
help O.B. with the horses.

Come on.

Get 'em out of this cold
'fore that blizzard hits us.

Whoa. You all right?

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

Esperate, esperate, esperate!

I just put those
other horses away.

You need it done
fast, you need to help.

I got two of my best men on it.

You heard him, freeloaders.

Get to work!

All right, you two,
unhook the leaders.

Come on, let's go.

Open up!

- You have to kick it open!
- Ya got to kick it open!

What?

Kick it open!

Shut that door.

There's a goddamn
blizzard out there!

You have to stop,
close the door!

You got to nail it shut.

You have to, you
have to nail it shut!

Hold it shut!

There's a hammer
and nails by the door!

You have to nail it shut!

There's a hammer
and nails by the door.

- Give me a hammer.
- Yeah.

You need, you need
two pieces of wood!

You need two pieces of
wood! One ain't good enough!

Two pieces of wood!

The fuckin' thing is busted!

Not just one piece of wood!

Give me another piece of wood.

Yeah. All right.

- I need a nail.
- Here.

Jesus.

That door's a son of a gun.

Who's the idiot who broke that,

that Mexican fella?

Oh, good heavens.

A woman?

Out in this white hell?

You must be frozen
solid, poor thing.

Looks like Minnie's
got her a full house.

When did you fellas arrive?

Ah.

About 40 minutes ago.

That cowboy fella in the corner,

- that your driver?
- No, no, he's a passenger.

The driver lit out.

Said he was going
to spend the blizzard

shacked up with a friend.

Lucky devil.

Jesus Christ, that's awful!

Christ Almighty,

what'd that Mexican fella do,
soak his old socks in a pot?

Yes, uh... I-I think we
all felt the same way,

but were a little too
polite to say something.

- He don't have that problem.
- Shit.

Where's the well water?

Uh, over there.

So, all three of you
fellas headed to Red Rock

when the blizzard
stopped you, huh?

Yes. All three of us were
on that stagecoach out there.

Coffee beans.

Uh, over there.

Get your hand out of there.

New sheriff of Red
Rock's travelin' with us.

Ah, sheriff of Red
Rock, that'll be the day.

He's a goddamn sheriff,
I'm a monkey's uncle.

Good.

Then you can share bananas

with your nigger
friend in the stable.

So,

the new sheriff of Red
Rock is traveling with you?

Oh, he's lying.

He ain't sheriff of nothin'.

He's a Southern renegade.

He's just talking hisself

out of freezing to death is all.

What the fuck I tell
you about talking, huh?

I'll bust you in the mouth

right in front of these
people. I don't give a fuck!

You never gave your name, sir.

John Ruth.

Are you a lawman?

I'm taking her to the law.

So you're a bounty hunter?

That's right, buster.

Do you have a warrant?

Yeah, course I do.

May I see it?

Why?

Ah. You're supposed to
produce it upon request.

How am I supposed to
know you're not a villain,

kidnapping this woman,

without a warrant
in your possession?

What's your name, buster?

Well, it certainly isn't Buster.

It's Oswaldo Mobray.

Oswaldo?

Yes.

Well,

I got my warrant, Oswaldo.

I take it you're Daisy Domergue?

- That's her.
- Yeah.

I see.

Uh, it says here
"dead or alive."

Yeah. It does.

Well, transporting a desperate,

hostile prisoner such as her

sounds like hard work.

Wouldn't transporting
her be easier

if she were dead?

Well, no one said the job
was supposed to be easy.

And why is her hanging
proper so important to you?

Let's just say I don't like
cheatin' the hangman.

He got to make a living, too.

Well, I appreciate that.

Allow me to properly

introduce myself.

I'm Oswaldo Mobray,

the hangman in these parts.

- La-di-da.
- Ah.

Looks like I brought
you a customer.

Yeah, so it would appear.

You ever spent two days or more

locked up with one of
your customers before?

- I can't say I have.
- Don't talk to my prisoner.

I talk to my
prisoner, that's it.

- You got it?
- I got it.

Jolly good.

You got anything in
here besides coffee

that can help warm us up?

Well, the bar is open.

Follow moi.

Line, O.B.!

Oh, whoa.

Oh.

Whoa.

♪♪

Hey.

Whoa, Ace, whoa.

You're all right,
you're all right.

Come on, goddamn it. I'm cold!

I'll feed and water the horses.

You go inside and
get some hot coffee.

Got some stew cooking.

Should be done soon.

Now, look.

No matter how bad
this blizzard gets,

we still got to
feed these horses

and take a squat
from time to time.

So me and Chris
better lay out a line

from the stable
to the front door

and from the front
door to the shithouse.

Okay?

Good idea.

Come on, Chris.

I'll give you a hand.

Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Go inside. Get warm.

You're doin' stable work
in a goddamn blizzard.

I offer to help, you say no?

You're right, amigo.

Muchas gracias.

All right. Follow me.

We're gonna drop
one every ten paces,

- from here to the door.
- Yeah!

All right!

♪♪

Now, you're wanted for murder.

For the sake of my analogy,

let's just assume
that you did it.

Now, John Ruth wants to
take you back to Red Rock

to stand trial for murder.

And if you're found guilty,

the people of Red Rock

will hang you in
the town square.

And, as the hangman,

I will perform the execution.

And if all those things

end up taking place,

that's what civilized society

calls justice.

However,

if the relatives
and the loved ones

of the person you murdered

were outside that
door right now,

and after busting
down that door,

they drug you out into the snow

and hung you up by the neck,

that would be frontier justice.

Now, the good part

about frontier justice

is it's very thirst-quenching.

The bad part is it's
apt to be wrong as right.

Well, not in your case.

In your case, you'd
have it coming.

But other people,
maybe not so much.

But ultimately, what's
the real difference

between the two?

The real difference is me.

The hangman.

To me, it doesn't
matter what you did.

When I hang you, I'll get no
satisfaction from your death.

It's my job.

I hang you in Red Rock.

I move on to the next town.

I hang someone else there.

The man who pulls the
lever that breaks your neck

will be a dispassionate man.

And that dispassion is
the very essence of justice.

For justice delivered
without dispassion

is always in danger
of not being justice.

Amen.

No offense, cowboy fella.

Just gettin' your attention.

Yeah, well...

you got it.

What you writin', friend?

Only thing I'm
qualified to write about.

What's that?

My life story.

You're writing your life story?

You bet I am.

Am I in it?

You just entered.

Well, you like writing
stories so much,

why don't you tell me the
story that brings you here?

Who's asking?

I am. John Ruth.

I'm bringing in this one
to Red Rock to hang.

And ain't no way I'm
spending a couple of nights

under a roof with somebody
I don't know who they are,

and I don't know who you are.

So, who are you?

Joe Gage.

- What?
- That's my name.

Joe Gage.

Okay, Joe Gage.

Why you going to Red Rock?

I ain't, I ain't, I ain't
going to Red Rock.

Where you going?

About nine miles
outside of Red Rock.

What's there?

My mother.

Your mother?

Listen, I'm just a cowpuncher.

I just, uh, got back
from a long drive, and...

and I wasn't just an
ass in a saddle this time.

I was a partner.

First time in my life I
made a pretty penny.

And, uh,

figured I'd come home

and spend time with my mother

for Christmas.

Now, that's funny.

'Cause you don't look like

the
coming-home-for-Christmas type.

Yeah, well,

you know, looks
can be deceiving.

Because I definitely am a

coming-home-for-Christmas-
to-spend-time-with-Mother type.

Christmas with
Mother, I mean, uh,

it's a wonderful thing.

Now, is that, uh,

good enough for you,

John Ruth?

For now.

You steer clear of my prisoner.

Hello, old-timer.

General.

General.

You, sir, are a hyena.

I have no wish to speak to you.

I've been called worse.

Fair enough, General.

Sorry to bother you.

CHRIS and O.B.: Hey!

- You gotta kick it open!
- Gotta kick it open!

- CHRIS and O.B.: What?
- Kick it open!

- That latch, you gotta kick it open!
- You gotta kick it open!

Jesus Christ!

- Close it!
- Close it!

- Close the door!
- What?

- Close it!
- The goddamn door!

It doesn't have
a latch. Close it!

It's already cold
enough in here!

Doesn't have a latch.

- You gotta hammer up a board.
- You gotta nail it shut!

The hammer and
nails by the door.

There's a hammer
and nails right there!

Ah, God!

- Hold this here, Chris.
- Here! Here.

- Watch your fingers.
- Yeah.

- Really nail it in!
- Yeah.

You need two pieces of wood.

You got to hammer another one.

One ain't good enough!

It's gonna blow right open!

Now, goddamn it!

Gonna open if you don't ham...!

- Shut up!
- Ah, got it!

Son of a bitch!

Jesus Christ.

That's door's a whore.

Oh.

I get it. "Haberdashery."

That was a joke.

How's the coffee?

Now? Pretty good,
if I do say so myself.

Thank you.

Ooh!

Ha! Navajo!

Guess who he is.

Buffalo Bill?

Hardly.

No. I'm...

Oswaldo Mobray. I'm the...

He's the hangman of Red Rock.

Oh, you are?

- Yes, I am.
- Well!

- Uh, good to meet
you, uh, - Yeah.

- Mr...?
- Uh, Mobray.

- Mobray.
- Yeah.

I'm Chris Mannix.

The new sheriff in Red Rock.

- Really?
- Pfft, horseshit!

Pay no attention to him.

Horseshit!

Fella warmin' himself
by that potbelly stove

- is a hell of a driver named O.B.
- Ah.

That's the only thing
you've said that's the truth.

You comin' into Red Rock
to hang Lance Lawson?

- Precisely.
- Do you have the execution orders on you?

- In my bag.
- May I see 'em?

Of course.

Who's, uh, who's Lance Lawson?

He's a fella been sittin'
in the Red Rock jail

about a month now.

He's the fella
who shot the fella

who was sheriff 'fore me.

Precisely.

Thank you.

What did she mean when she said,

"The bounty hunter's
nigger friend in the stable"?

He's got a nigger bounty
hunter friend in the stable.

But all that just to guard her?

Uh, I don't think that
was the original idea, but...

- that's the idea now.
- Oh. Mm.

Want a little snake
bite in your coffee?

Yeah.

Five of you?

Well, well, well, looks
like Minnie's Haberdashery

is about to get cozy
for the next few days.

Yes, it does.

- Here.
- Ah. Ah.

Are you the chap
with the Lincoln letter?

The Lincoln what?

Yes. The letter from
Abraham Lincoln.

President Abraham Lincoln?

Yes. Weren't you pen pals?

With the president?

Well, I'm sorry, I heard
that somebody in your party

had a letter from
Abraham Lincoln.

I assumed it was you.

Not him!

Black fella in the stable.

The nigger...

in the stable has a letter
from Abraham Lincoln?

Yeah.

The nigger in the stable has
a letter from Abraham Lincoln?

What'd you say your
name was again?

- Bob.
- Warren.

Minnie and Sweet Dave in there?

Minnie and Sweet Dave
went to visit her mother

on the north side
of the mountain.

- What?
- Yeah.

Minnie ain't here?

Yes, they're
visiting her mother.

- Her mother?
- Yes.

Hmm.

Never knew Minnie had a mother.

Well, everybody's got a mother.

Yeah, I suppose.

And she left you in charge?

Si.

That sure don't
sound like Minnie.

Are you calling me a liar?

Well, not yet I ain't.

Just sounds peculiar is all.

What sounds peculiar?

Well, first off, Minnie
never struck me

as the sentimental type.

And secondly, I can't imagine
Sweet Dave lifting his fat ass

out his chair long
enough to fetch well water

unless Minnie was laying a
frying pan upside his head,

let alone take a
trip to the north side.

Well, that sounds a whole lot

like you're calling me
a liar, mi negro amigo.

Yeah, it do sound a
whole lot like that, don't it?

But I still ain't done it yet.

Minnie still serve food?

- Do you consider stew food?
- Yes.

Then we serve food.

She still stinking up the place
with Old Quail pipe tobacco?

Minnie doesn't smoke a pipe.

She rolls her own.

Red Apple Tobacco.

But, mi negro amigo, I
think you already know this.

Yeah, I do, Senor Bob.

Just seeing if you do.

Come on!

Fill 'er up, O.B.

Yeah.

Goddamn it.

Thank you.

Well, cut my legs off
and call me Shorty.

Is that General
Sanford Smithers I see?

You got a good eye, son.

Ha-ha! Well, I'll be
double-dog damned!

General Sandy "Don't
Give a Damn" Smithers?

Captain Chris Mannix,
Mannix's Marauders.

Erskine's boy?

Yes, sir.

Uh... may I sit down, sir?

Well, according to the
Yankees, it's a free country.

General Sandy Smithers. Ha-ha!

Boy...

oh, boy,

did my daddy talk about you!

I heard you gave those
Blue Bellies sweet hell.

Me and my boys did our part.

Just like Erskine and
his boys did their part.

Hell yeah, we did.

Yankee sons of bitches.

I never knew your father, son.

But I always
respected his resolve.

Well, thank you for
saying that, General.

Your respect would have
meant the world to him.

Can I get you some coffee?

That'd be nice.

Well, how about a blanket?

That'd be even nicer.

Hell, you know what?
You can have mine.

Here we go, General.

Ha-ha! So what brings
you out Wyoming way, sir?

If you don't mind my askin'.

My boy.

- Oh, you got a boy that lives in Red Rock?
- My son.

Chester Charles Smithers.

He died out here
a few years back.

Oh, forgive me, sir.

There's no forgiveness
needed, son.

Like I said, it was
a few years back.

It was after he'd
served his service.

He came out here to
the hills of Wyoming...

to make his fortune.

Never to be heard from again.

I bought him a symbolic plot...

in the Red Rock cemetery.

And I'm here to advise a
stone maker on his headstone.

Was he a goner for sure?

No chance he could
be livin' the cold life

out in the woods?

It's a rough life,
but folks can learn it.

If he'd have done what
he came out here to do,

he'd have come home.

Hold it. Close it, close it!

You have to hold it
closed while I nail it shut.

Well, who's the idiot
broke the damn door?

Oh, j-j-j...

just fucking hold it closed!

Orale, cabron!

Hold it closed.

Okay.

One more.

Keep holding, keep holding,

my negro amigo.

We need two pieces of wood.

Orale, cabron! All right.

There you go, motherfucker!

Lot of hats, Senor Bob.

Huh?

Considering Minnie's
"no hats indoors" policy,

which, if I remember correctly,

was one of them
Bar of Iron rules.

Kind of rule she'd want
kept up in her absence.

You seem to have a
laissez-faire attitude

when it come to the hats.

I'm guilty.

I have a laissez-faire
attitude about the hats.

How about we forget
about the hats today

considering there is a
blizzard going on and on?

We'll make tomorrow
"No Hat Day"!

Do you know that nigger, sir?

I don't know that nigger.

But I know he's a nigger,
and that's all I need to know.

Well...

that nigger just
ain't any nigger.

That nigger, he...

General Sanford Smithers?

Battle of Baton Rouge?

Inform the nigger

in the cavalry officer's uniform

that I had a division
of Confederates

under my command...

in Baton Rouge.

Major Nigger, General Smithers
wishes me to inform you...

I heard him, hillbilly.

Inform this old cracker that
I was in Baton Rouge also.

On the other side.

Oh, that's interesting.

Uh, General Smithers,

he said that he was also in
Baton Rouge on the other si...

Captain Mannix,

tell the nigger

that I don't acknowledge niggers

in Northern uniforms.

You captured a whole
colored command

that day...

but not one colored trooper
made it to a camp, did they?

We didn't have the
time or the food...

nor the inclination...

to care for Northern horses

and least of all...

Northern niggers!

So we shot 'em where they stood!

Gentlemen.

Gentlemen.

I know Americans aren't apt

to let a little thing like
unconditional surrender

get in the way of a good war.

But I strongly suggest
we don't restage

the Battle of Baton Rouge

during a blizzard in
Minnie's Haberdashery.

Now, uh...

my Nubian friend...

while I realize
passions are high,

that was a while ago.

And if you shoot this
unarmed old man,

I guarantee I will
hang you by the neck

until you are dead once
we arrive in Red Rock.

I damn well guarantee that, too.

Yeah, Warren,

that's the problem with old men.

You can kick 'em down the stairs

and say it's a accident,
but you can't just shoot 'em.

Uh, gentlemen... since we may be

trapped here,

close together-like,

for a few days,

may I suggest a
possible solution?

We divide Minnie's in half.

The Northern side

and the Southern side.

With the dinner table...

operating as a...

neutral territory.

We could say
that the fireplace...

side of the room acts as a...

a symbolic representative of...

Georgia.

While the bar...

represents...

Philadelphia!

Long as the bar's
Philadelphia...

I agree.

We still got that deal we
talked about in the wagon?

- Thank you.
- I help you protect your $8,000,

- you help me protect my ten?
- Yeah, I suppose.

One of them fellas

is not what he says he is.

What is he?

In cahoots with this
one, that's what he is.

One of them, maybe
even two of them,

is here to see
Domergue goes free.

To accomplish that goal,
they'll kill everybody in here.

They got 'em a couple of days,

so all they got
to do is sit tight

and wait for a
window of opportunity.

And that's when they strike.

Huh, bitch?

If you say so, John.

Are you sure you ain't
just being paranoid?

Our best bet is
this duplicitous fella

ain't as cool a
customer as Daisy here.

He won't have the
leather patience it takes

to just sit here and... wait.

Waiting for an opportunity

and knowing it's the
right one isn't so easy.

He can't handle it,

he'll stop waitin'.

Try and create his opportunity,

and that's when
Mr. Jumpy reveals himself.

Now, what you got
to say about all this?

What do I got to say?

About John Ruth's ravings?

He's absolutely right.

Me and one of them
fellas is in cahoots.

We're just waiting for
everybody to go to sleep.

That's when we're
gonna kill y'all.

Okay, everybody.

Hear this.

This here is Daisy Domergue.

She's wanted dead
or alive for murder.

$10,000.

That money's mine, boys.

Don't want to share it,

and I ain't gonna lose it.

When that sun comes out,

I'm taking this woman
into Red Rock to hang.

Now...

is there anybody here

committed to stoppin' me...

from doing that?

Really?

Nobody got a problem with this?

Well...

I guess that's very
fortunate for me.

However...

I hope you all understand

I can't just...

take your word.

Circumstances force me to...

take...

precautions.

When you say...

"precautions"...

why do I feel that you mean me?

Because I'm gonna
take your gun, son.

You are?

Yes, I am.

- Nothing personal.
- Just mine?

Hangman's got
himself a gun, too.

I'll be dealing with his
gun after I deal with yours.

I feel kind of...

naked without it.

Oh, I still got mine.

I'll protect you.

A bastard's work is never done.

Huh, John Ruth?

That's right, Joe Gage.

- Now, give me the gun.
- If you want it...

you're gonna have
to come and take...

Calm down.

Take your hand
away from your gun.

Blink if you're calm.

He blink?

He blinked.

Blink if you're
gonna remain calm.

He blinked.

Take his pistol.

I'm real sorry about this, son.

Like I said...

nothing personal, just...

a precaution.

Pretty sneaky.

Afraid the same
applies to you, too,

Mr... Mobray.

Ah, precautions must be taken

because life is
too sweet to lose.

Hand me that little bucket.

O.B.

Go to the outhouse.

Take this bucket and...
dump it down the shithole.

Why do I got to go outside?

Well, your jacket's already on,

and I sorta kinda trust you.

- Grab the other cup.
- Yeah, I got it.

After you, Major.

Okay.

I'm gonna cut you
loose while we eat.

Don't get any ideas.
I ain't goin' soft on ya.

Lift your ass even
one inch off that seat,

and I'll put a bullet right
in your goddamn throat.

Come here.

Oh.

So, Domergue...

I suppose this blizzard
counts as a stroke of luck

far as you're concerned.

You don't hear me
complainin', do ya?

No, I sure don't.

Well, how 'bout you, Oswaldo?

How 'bout me what?

Look...

considering all the
things I done for money,

I ain't one to judge, but...

don't you feel just
the least little bad

about hangin' a woman?

Well, until they invent a
trigger a woman can't pull,

if you're a hangman,
you're going to hang women.

Well, hell, Ozzie, I guess

I ain't never looked
at it like that before.

When it comes to some of
them mean bastards out there,

it's the only thing
does the job.

You really only need
to hang mean bastards.

But mean bastards,
you need to hang.

You goddamn son of a bitch!

I almost died out there!

I ain't ever... going
out in that shit

ever, ever again!

You okay, O.B.?

I'm fine.

I'll be fine.

I just need to get warm.

You want some stew, O.B.?

Stew?

Later.

Oh, yeah.

That's nice.

So...

how you doing, Black Major?

I ain't in the mood,
Chris Mannix.

Leave me be from your horseshit.

John Ruth says you
got a Lincoln letter.

I told you, jackass, go
hee-haw someplace else.

That's right, John.

You did say that, didn't you?

Yeah. I did.

So...

you got a letter from
Abraham Lincoln?

Yes.

The... Abraham Lincoln?

Yes.

Abraham Lincoln?

The president of
the United States?

Yes.

Of America?

Yes.

Wrote you a letter...

personally?

Yes.

Personally, as in
"Dear Major Warren"?

No, personally, as
in "Dear Marquis."

"Dear Marquis"?

Abraham Lincoln,

the president of the
United States of America?

Yes.

May I see it?

No, you may not.

But the way John tells it,

you weren't just some
random nigger soldier

picked from a pile of letters.

Way John tells it...

y'all had a correspondence.

Yes.

The way John tells it...

y'all was practically pen pals.

Yes.

And a pen pal's...

practically a friend.

John Ruth...

you really think a nigger,

drummed out of the cavalry
with a yellow stripe down his back,

was practically friends

with the president of the
United States of America?

John Ruth, I hate to be
the one to break it to you,

but ain't nobody in Minnie's
Haberdashery ever corresponded

with Abraham Lincoln.

Least of all,

that nigger there!

Was all that horseshit?

Course it was.

Good one, Warren!

Talk that sass, nigger!

Talk that sass!

Well, I guess it's true what
they say about you people.

Can't trust a fuckin' word
comes out of your mouth.

What's the matter, John Ruth?

I hurt your feelings?

As a matter of fact...

you did.

I-I know...

I'm the only black son of a
bitch you ever conversed with,

so I'm gonna cut you some slack.

But you got no
idea what it's like

being a black man
facin' down America.

Only time black folks is safe

is when white folks is disarmed.

And this letter had
the desired effect

of disarmin' white folks.

Call it what you want.

I call it a dirty fuckin' trick.

You want to know why I lie

about somethin'
like that, white man?

Got me on that
stagecoach, didn't it?

Well, I'll tell you like
the good Lord told John.

A letter from Abraham
Lincoln wouldn't have had

that kind of effect on me.

I might let a whore piss on it.

- I spit on it.
- Good for you, sister!

Warren.

Goddamn it, you leave
that old man alone.

Stand down, you son of a bitch.

I shared a battlefield
with this man.

Or would you deny me that, too?

I suppose you were there.

May I join you?

Yes, you may.

Damn it.

So, how's life since the war?

Got both my legs.

Both my arms.

I can't complain.

Got a woman?

Fever took her start
of this last winter.

Mm.

What was her name?

Betsy.

Georgia gal?

Augusta.

Atlanta boy, Augusta girl.

I used to raise Kentucky horses.

And her pa was the
owner of the breedership

where I bought
most of my ponies.

Goddamn it.

I made a good deal on her.

Took the stake he gave me

and bought a bunch
of peach orchards.

Set myself up pretty well.

Did a hell of a lot better

than either one of my no-good
brothers, that's for damn sure.

Hmm.

Yeah, your boy come
up here a few years back.

He spoke highly
of his mama, too.

You knew my boy?

Did I know him?

Yep.

Yeah, I knew him.

You did not know my boy.

Suit yourself.

Did you know my son?

I know the day he died.

- Do you?
- No.

Do you want to know
what day that was?

Yes.

The day...

he met me.

He come up here

to do a little
nigger head-huntin'.

By then, the reward was, oh...

$5,000 and braggin' rights.

But to battle-hard rebs,

$5,000 just to cut
off a nigger's head?

That's good money.

So them Johnnies
climbed this mountain,

lookin' for fortune.

There wasn't no
fortune to be found.

All they found...

was me.

All them crackers come
up here sang a different tune

when they found theyself at
the mercy of a nigger's gun.

Let's just forget it.

I'll go my way, you go your'n.

That's your boy Chester talkin'.

You're a goddamn lie!

"If you just let me go home

"to my family, I-I swear...

I'll never set foot
in Wyoming again."

That's what they all said.

Beggin' for his life...

your boy told me

his whole life story.

And you...

was in that story, General.

And when I knew me I had

the son...

of the Bloody Nigger
Killer of Baton Rouge...

I knew me I was
gonna have some fun.

You shut your
lyin' nigger lips up!

General Smithers,
don't you listen to him.

He didn't know your boy.

He just heard tell
why you're here, is all.

It was cold the day
I killed your boy.

And I don't mean

snowy-mountain-Wyoming
cold, uh-uh.

It was colder than that.

And on that cold
day, with your boy

at the business
end of my gun barrel,

I made him strip...

right down to his bare ass.

Then I told him
to start walkin'.

♪♪

♪♪

I walked his naked
ass for two hours

'fore the cold collapsed him.

You never even knew my boy?

No, he didn't!

He's just a sneaky nigger

trying to get you
to go for that gun.

Then... he commenced
to beggin' again.

But this time, he wasn't
beggin' to go home.

Ah, he knew he'd never
see his home again.

He wasn't beggin'
for his life, neither,

'cause he knew
that was long gone.

All he wanted...

was a blanket.

Now, don't judge your
boy too harshly, General.

You ain't never been cold
as your boy was that day.

You'd be surprised

what a man that cold

would do for a blanket.

You want to know
what your boy did?

I pulled my big black pecker

out of my pants...

and I made him
crawl through the snow

on all fours over to it.

♪♪

Then I grabbed me a handful

of that black hair

at the back of his head...

and I stuck my big black johnson

right down his goddamn throat.

And it was full of
blood, so it was warm.

Oh, you bet your
sweet ass it was warm.

And Chester Charles Smithers

sucked on that warm black dingus

for long as he could!

You're startin' to
see pictures, ain't ya?

Your boy...

black dude's
dingus in his mouth...

him sh-sh-shakin', him cryin',

me laughin'...

and him not understandin'.

But you understand,
don't you, Sandy?

I never did give your
boy that blanket...

even after all he did,

and he did everything I asked.

No blanket.

That blanket was just a
heart-breakin' liar's promise.

Kind of like those uniforms

the Union issued
those colored troops

that you chose
not to acknowledge.

So what you gonna
do, old man? Hmm?

You gonna spend the
next two, three days

ignorin' the nigger
that killed your boy?

Ignorin' how I made him suffer?

Ignoring how I made him...

lick... all over my johnson?

Oh, the dumbest
thing your boy ever did

was to let me know...

he was your boy.

About 15 minutes has past

since we last left
our characters.

Joe Gage volunteered to take
Smithers' dead body outside.

Straws were drawn
to see who'd help him.

O.B. lost.

Chris, John Ruth and
Oswaldo had a vigorous debate

about the legality of
the self-defense murder

that just transpired.

Major Marquis Warren,
who was supremely confident

about the legality of
what just transpired,

ignored them, sat at
the table by himself

and drank brandy.

Captain Chris Mannix
donned the dead general's coat

and joined Oswaldo in lighting
the candles and lanterns.

Hey, Ozzie!

Now, you got the right idea.

Let's light this place up.

John Ruth held the door closed,

waiting for Joe Gage
and O.B. to return.

Bob enjoyed a Manzana Roja.

Domergue, however,
hasn't moved from her spot

at the community dinner table
since John Ruth uncuffed her.

John Ruth.

Yeah.

Can I play that
guitar over there?

Let's go back a bit.

Your boy, black dude's
dingus in his mouth.

15 minutes ago, Major Warren

shot General Smithers
in front of everybody.

But about 40
seconds before that,

something equally as
important happened,

but not everybody saw it.

While Major Warren
was captivating the crowd

with tales of black
dicks in white mouths,

somebody...

poisoned the coffee.

He did everything I asked.

No blanket.

And the only one
to see him do it...

was Domergue.

That's why this
chapter is called

"Domergue's Got a Secret."

John Ruth.

Yeah.

Can I play that
guitar over there?

Yeah.

You come back with
anything else but a guitar,

my pistol plays a tune.

"Domergue's Death March."

You got it?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it.

Chris Mannix, come
over here on this side.

Come on.

Take this gun out my holster.

Point it at them.

Now, like I said,

anybody does anything,

and I mean anything,

you kill 'em.

So...

you finally decided
I'm tellin' the truth

about bein' the sheriff
of Red Rock, huh?

I don't know about all that.

But I know you ain't the
killer poisoned that coffee,

'cause you almost drunk
it your own damn self.

One of them is.

Aah!

Ow!

Give me the key.
Give me the key!

You motherfucking black bastard!

You're gonna die
on this mountain,

and I'm gonna fucking
laugh when you do!

What'd I say 'bout talkin'?

Bastard.

Meant it, didn't I?

And you need to understand

you just killed
the only man here

committed to gettin'
you to Red Rock alive.

Now, one of y'all...

is workin' with her.

Or two of y'all is
workin' with her.

Or all y'all is.

But only one of you

poisoned the coffee.

Now, what charms this bitch got

make a man brave a blizzard,

kill in cold blood?

I'm sure I don't know.

But John Ruth's tryin'
to hang your woman.

So you kill him.

Okay.

Maybe.

But O.B. wasn't hangin' nobody.

He damn sure wasn't.

But he sure enough
layin' over there dead

now, though, ain't he?

He damn sure is,
you sons of bitches.

Just like any one of us
would've drunk that coffee.

Like me, goddamn it.

Now, those of y'all with
your hands on the wall

don't practice in poison

need to think about that.

Think about how it
could've been you

rollin' around
here on this floor.

And how the man
standin' next to you

would be responsible.

And I know who I
got my money on.

Oh, that's right, Joe Gage.

I'm lookin' at you.

Not so fast, Chris.

We'll get there.

Let's slow it down.

Let's slow it way down.

Who made the coffee?

He did.

Yeah, he did, didn't he?

Yeah, he did, didn't he?

But it's the stew
that's got me thinkin'.

Now, how long you
said Minnie been gone?

A week?

Si.

See...

my mama used to make stew,

and it always tasted the same,

no matter the meat.

And there was another
fellow on the plantation,

Uncle Charly.

He made stew, too.

And like my mama,

I ate his stew from the
time I was a whipper

till I was a full-grown man.

No matter the meat,

it always tasted like
Uncle Charly's stew.

Now, I ain't had Minnie's stew

in six months, so
I ain't no expert.

But that damn sure is...

Minnie's stew.

So if Minnie is
on the north side

visitin' her mama for a week,

how'd she make
the stew this mornin'?

Hmm.

And this...

this is Sweet Dave's chair.

When I sat in it earlier,

I couldn't believe it.

Nobody sits in
Sweet Dave's chair.

Uh, this may be Minnie's place,

but this is damn sure

Sweet Dave's chair.

And if he went
to the north side...

I'm pretty goddamn sure

this chair be goin' with him.

What's in the chair?

Just what I thought.

Sweet Dave's goddamn blood.

Hoo!

Hoo-hoo-hoo!

So, are you actually
accusing me of murder?

Way I see it, Senor Bob,

is whoever is workin' with her

ain't who they say they is.

And if it's you,

that means Minnie and her man

ain't at her mama's.

They layin' out back
there dead somewhere.

Or if it's you,
little British man,

the real Oswaldo Mobray
layin' in a ditch somewhere

and you just a English
fella passin' off his papers.

Or we go by my theory,

which is the ugliest guy did it.

Which makes it you, Joe Gage.

So I take it you deduced
the coffee was poisoned

while you were
murdering the old man?

Yes.

Well, mi negro amigo,

during that whole incident,

I was sitting on
that side of the room

playing "Silent
Night" on the piano.

Oh, I ain't say you
poisoned the coffee.

I said you didn't make the stew.

My theory is...

you workin' with the man

who poisoned the coffee,

and both of y'all
murdered Minnie,

Sweet Dave and whoever
else picked this bad-luck day

to visit Minnie's
Haberdashery this mornin'.

And at some
point, y'all intended

to bushwhack John Ruth

and free Daisy.

But you didn't
count on the blizzard,

and you didn't count
on the two of us.

Hmm.

That's far as I got.
How am I doing?

You're a real
imaginative nigger,

ain't you?

So, do you intend to murder me

based on a far-fetched
nigger theory,

or can you prove it, cabron?

It ain't so far-fetched,
Senor Bob.

And it's a little bit
more than a theory.

How long you say you
been workin' for Minnie?

Four months.

Mmm.

See, if you'd have been
here two and a half years ago,

you'd know 'bout that sign
used to hang up over the bar.

Minnie mention that to you?

No.

You want to know what
that sign said, Senor Bob?

"No dogs or Mexicans allowed."

Now, Minnie hung that sign up

the day she opened
this haberdashery.

And it hung over
that bar every day

till she took it down a
little over two years ago.

You know why she took it down?

She started lettin' in dogs.

Now, Minnie liked
just about everybody,

but she sure don't

like Mexicans.

So when you tell me

Minnie went to the north
side to visit her mama,

well, I find that
highly unlikely.

But okay, maybe.

But when you tell me

Minnie Mink took
the haberdashery,

the most precious thing
to her in the whole world,

and left it in the hands
of a goddamn Mexican?

Well, that's what I
meant in the barn

when I said that sure
don't sound like Minnie.

Now I am calling you a liar,

Senor Bob.

And if you lyin',

which you are...

then you killed Minnie.

And Sweet Dave.

Four measly bullets,

and there goes Senor Bob.

But that still don't
get us no closer

to which one of y'all
poisoned the coffee, though.

Do it, Chris?

No, it sure don't.

Now, one of y'all
poisoned this coffee

to free Daisy.

If I don't hear a confession

from one of you motherfuckers
quick, fast and in a hurry,

I'm gonna pour this
whole pot of coffee

down that bitch's
goddamn throat.

Okay. Time's up.

Stop!

All right, I did it.

It was me. I
poisoned the coffee.

I fuckin' knew it!

Oh!

You gonna die now,

All right, you two,
unhook the leaders.

Come on, let's go!

Open up!

- You have to kick it open!
- Ya gotta kick it open!

- What?
- Kick it open!

How you doin', old boy?

They shot my nuts off.

I'm freezin', burnin'
up the same time.

Bleedin' like a stuck pig.

I think I'm gonna die.

And these motherfuckers did it.

That's how I'm doin'.

How you doin'?

Well, my leg hurts really bad.

But I think, if I put all my
weight on my right foot...

I was just bein' sarcastic.

I don't give a fuck
about your leg.

Huh.

Now, you just...

make yourself comfortable.

Don't worry about my comfort.

Shit, I can't feel
my ass no more.

Worry about these owl hoots

and that bushwhackin'
nut shooter in the basement.

All right!

You... fella in the basement!

You either give up by
the time I count to three...

or I shoot Domergue in the head.

One!

Two!

No, no, no, no, don't
shoot her in the head!

I'm coming up.

Hold on now, you
bushwhackin' sack shooter!

You just open the door.

We tell you when to come up.

Now throw out your pistol.

Toward the bed.

Bet he got another.

Now throw out your other pistol.

I ain't got another pistol!

Well, you better shit
another pistol out your ass,

'cause if you don't
throw one up here

in the next two seconds,
we gonna kill this bitch.

See?

Told you.

Now, with your hands
where we can see 'em,

slowly come on up.

How you doing, dummy?

Better, now I see
your ugly face.

How you like that?!

You bushwhackin' castrator!

What are you doing?!
He was giving up!

It took him too long,
so I done it for him.

Joe Gage, get your ass over
here and shut this trap door.

I'm sorry, honey.

May I sit in a chair?

Yes, you may.

Keep your hands
flat on that table.

And don't move 'em.

Mannix!

You sure picked the wrong
time to turn into a nigger lover.

Don't you see, that
nigger and John Ruth

put you smack dab in
the middle of danger?

You're about to be murdered

in some nigger
named Minnie's house,

and you don't even know why!

Okay... bitch.

I'll bite.

Why?

I'm working with all
three of them fellas.

But not 'cause they got
butterflies in their belly

about me, but because
we're all gang members.

The Jody Domingre Gang.

That fella y'all just
killed in the basement

was Jody Domingre!

My brother!

Well, who the hell
is Jody Domingre?

You want to tell
him, bounty man?

He was a big bad
cat worth $50,000.

And every member of his
gang was worth at least ten.

Which finally explains
why you worth ten.

And what's gonna happen
when that sun comes out, nigger?

So is my brother's 15 men
coming straight here for us.

Tell him, Grouch!

Jody got 15 men
waiting in Red Rock.

We couldn't kill John
Ruth and free Daisy here,

their job was to sack
the town, kill John Ruth

and free Daisy there.

Now, with my brother dead,
I'm in charge of this gang.

- Right, boys?
- That's right, Daisy.

Oh, yeah.

And, Chris, I am telling you,

you ain't done anything
yet that we can't forgive.

So, let's make a deal.

No deals, bitch.

You gonna let that nigger
speak for you, Chris?!

Hold it, Warren.

Seeing as how she
ain't got nothing to sell,

I'm kinda curious
about her sales pitch.

Humor me.

All right... bitch.

What's... your... deal?

Easy.

Take your gun,
shoot that nigger dead.

Then we sit here all
nice-like for the next two days.

When the snow melts, we go to
Mexico, you go on to Red Rock,

get that star pinned
on your chest.

Hey, Pete. How
much can we pay him?

Well, we could give him Marco.

Bob's real name is
Marco the Mexican.

He's worth $12,000.

That's Marco the Mexican?

Precisely, yeah.

Shit.

Now that I blowed his face
off, Marco ain't worth a peso.

Oh!

Oh, sh... Oh, sh...

Well, then, if I die
in the next two days,

which is more than
likely, you can have me.

Under the name of
English Pete Hicox,

I got a federal bounty
of $15,000 on my head.

It's all yours, Chris.

You keep talking, Pete,

you gonna talk
yourself to death.

Joe Gage, who you be?

Grouch Douglass.

You heard of him?

Yeah, I heard of
Grouch Douglass.

He worth ten, just like Daisy.

Well, remind me...

why we wouldn't just
kill all y'all, cash in.

Oh, you can kill us all, but
you'll never spend a cent

of that bounty money,

and you'll never leave
this mountain alive.

'Cause when that snow
melts, the rest of Jody's gang,

all 15 of 'em that are waiting
in Red Rock, are coming here.

Now, I-let's say
you shoot us all.

If you really want all that
Domingre Gang bounty money,

you still got to get all our
corpses into Red Rock.

And that ain't gonna be so easy.

'Cause I-I doubt you can
drive a four-horse team.

And that wagon out there is
too heavy for a two-horse team.

So that means you're
gonna have to lead

a string of horses
into Red Rock.

And with that deep
snow after a blizzard,

you ain't gonna be able to
get away with any more than,

say, one body per horse.

So that's you leading a string
of four horses into Red Rock.

And with all them
horses in that snow

and you all by your lonesome,
you're gonna be a mite poky.

And you're gonna run smack
dab into the Domingre Gang.

And again, Grouch,
how many is that?

15 killers strong.

And when those 15
killers come across you

in possession of
all our dead bodies,

they ain't just gonna
kill you and that nigger!

They gonna go back to Red Rock

and kill every son
of a bitch in that town!

You really the
sheriff of Red Rock?

You want to save the town?

Then shoot that nigger dead!

Jesus Christ!

Oh, ho, ho!

You believe in Jesus
now, huh, bitch?

Well, good, 'cause
you about to meet him.

Anybody else want
to make a deal? Huh?!

The deal still stands, Chris.

You ain't done
nothing we can't forgive.

It's all still on that nigger.

You shoot him
dead, take my body,

sit out in the snow

with Daisy and Grou...

You cunt!

♪♪

Mannix,

give me my pistol.

Give it here!

Give it here!

So, you were saying...

we sit here, all nice
and friendly like,

for the next two days.

Then the snow
melts, you leave here,

meet up with your gang,
and hightail it to Mexico.

That's the deal, right?

Yeah.

And I get Oswaldo and Joe Gage?

Yeah.

But Jody's worth $50,000.
What about his body?

You gonna make a deal

with this diabolical bitch?

I ain't saying I'm gonna
make a deal with her.

We just talking.

Calm down!

So what about Jody's
body and the $50,000?

You're getting greedy, reb.

No deal.

We're taking Jody's
body back with us.

He got children.

So I kill Warren,
and we all friends?

Yeah.

No deal, tramp.

Chris!

You're making the
biggest mistake of your life!

When our boys get
here in a couple of days,

they're gonna cut your nuts off!

And there won't be a stick
left in that town unburnt!

Well, I guess I should be
plumb scared right now, huh?

If you had any
brains, you would be!

You see...

here's the problem, Daisy.

In order for me to be
scared of your threats,

I got to believe in those
15 extra gang members

waiting it out in Red Rock.

And boy, oh, boy, I sure don't.

What I believe is,

Joe Gage or Grouch Douglass or
whatever the fuck his name was,

poisoned the coffee.

And you watched him do it.

And you watched me pour a
cup, and you didn't say shit!

And...

I believe you are what
you've always been,

a lying bitch who
will do anything

to cheat the rope waiting
for her in Red Rock,

including shitting out
15 extra gang members

whenever you need be.

Oh, oh!

And...

I believe, when it
comes to what's left

of the Jody Domingre
Gang, I'm looking at 'em.

Right here, right now,

dead on this
motherfucking floor!

Goddamn right.

Then you're gonna die
on this mountain, Chris.

'Cause my brother
leads an army of men.

Horseshit!

My daddy led an army.

He led a renegade army,
fighting for a lost cause!

My daddy held up to 400
men together after the war

with nothing but their
respect in his command!

Your brother's just an owl
hoot who led a gang of killers!

I don't feel so good.

Oh, shit.

♪♪

Ha!

You still alive, white boy?

Fuck!

Mannix!

Oh! Fuck!

Hey, boy!

Get up!

Chris Mannix!

If your ass ain't nailed to
the floor, wake the fuck up!

Wake up, white boy!

I ain't dead yet,
you black bastard.

Chris Mannix, I may
have misjudged you.

Now we've come to
the part of the story...

where I blow your
goddamn head off.

No! No, no, don't shoot her!

Why the hell not?

John Ruth.

Now, John Ruth was one
mighty, mighty bastard.

But the last thing that
bastard did 'fore he died

was save your life.

We gonna die, white boy.

We ain't got no say in that.

But there is one thing
left we do have a say in.

And that's how
we kill this bitch.

And I say shooting's
too good for her.

John Ruth could've shot her
anywhere anytime along the way.

But John Ruth was The Hangman.

And when The
Hangman catches you,

you don't die by no bullet.

When The Hangman
catches you, you hang.

"You only need to
hang mean bastards..."

Mm-hmm.

"but mean bastards,
you need to hang."

As my first and final act

as the sheriff of Red Rock,

I sentence you, Domergue,

to hang by the neck until death!

Hang on, Daisy.

I want to watch.

♪♪

Now, that was a nice dance.

Oh.

That sure was pretty.

Shit!

Hey.

Can I see that Lincoln letter?

"Dear Marquis,

"I hope this letter finds you

"in good health and stead.

"I'm doing fine,

"although I wish there
were more hours in a day.

"There's just so much to do.

"Times are changing
slowly but surely,

"and it's men like you
that will make a difference.

"Your military success
is a credit not only to you,

"but your race as well.

"I'm very proud every
time I hear news of you.

"We still have a long way to go,

"but hand in hand, I
know we will get there.

"I just want to let you
know you're in my thoughts.

"Hopefully, our paths
will cross in the future.

"Until then, I
remain your friend.

"Ole Mary Todd's calling,

Respectfully, Abraham Lincoln."

"Ole Mary Todd."

That's a nice touch.

Yeah.
