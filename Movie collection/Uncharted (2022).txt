Oh, crap!

Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!

That was purely reactive.

Whoa!

Whoa!

No! No!

Come on!

Nate! Come on.

I got you.

Help! I'm falling!

I got you. Come on.

- I got you.
- Oh, my God.

- Hey, hey. Keep it down.
- Oh, my God.

Hey. Hey.

What part of "wait for me"
did you not get?

I said I'm coming with you.

Okay. Okay.

We're looking for
the Age of Explorers exhibit.

So be quiet.

Bubble Yum?

That's my last piece.
Let's split it.

Hey.

Punk.

All right, smart guy.
Who's this?

Too easy.
Ferdinand Magellan.

First guy to sail
around the world.

Wrong. Magellan never made it
all the way around.

He just took all the credit.

Holy shit. There it is.

- What?
- Shh.

Come here.

First map of the whole world.

You know what Magellan
was really looking for?

Gold.

But he never made it home.

So all that gold,
it's just gone?

Whoa.

Lost. Not gone.

There's a difference.

If something's lost,
it can be found.

But lucky for us, we got
pirate blood in our veins.

Descended from
Sir Francis Drake himself.

At least, that...

was what Mom and Dad
used to say.

You know,

sometimes I think
they're out there somewhere.

Like they're just lost.

They're not lost.

They're gone.

All right.

This map is worth a fortune.

Here goes nothing.

Come on.

- Let's go. Hey.
- Hey!

- You two! Don't move.
- Hey! Hey!

Oh, crap.

We came here first
out of respect, Sister B.

But this is his third strike.

Go get your things, Sam.

You can't just let them
take him away.

Say your goodbyes.

What the hell?

I'm not letting them
lock me up.

No way.

I'm coming with you.

Not this time.

Come here.

You see me go anywhere
without this?

No.

So you know I will never
leave it behind.

I will always be with you.

It says "sic parvis magna."

"Greatness from
small beginnings."

That's you and me.

Let's go, kid.

I better get going.

I'll come back for you, Nate.

Promise.

Never forget, you're a Drake.

I love you.

Oh, well, well, well,
if it isn't

the late, great
and formerly employed Nate.

Well, at least you got
the "great" part right.

Hey, Goldie,
I brought your stuff up.

- Thank you.
- Hey, how was last night?

- Great.
- Yeah, he was cute?

- Very cute.
- Nice.

- Hey.
- Hi.

Excuse me.

Sorry.

Hey, what can I get you?

- A vodka tonic.
- Vodka tonic? Come on.

It's my first drink
of the night. Test me a little.

Uh, I don't know.

A... A negroni.

A ne-what?

Uh...

I'm kidding.

The negroni.

First made in 1919
for Count Camillo Negroni

when he swapped the soda water

in his usual drink,
the Americano,

for gin.

Haven't seen you
in here before.

It's not really
my neighborhood.

Not your neighborhood?
Where are you from?

- Greenwich.
- Greenwich. Sounds nice.

Bartenders up there
don't give history lessons.

Well, bartenders in Greenwich
don't make negronis like this.

You want to leave it
open or closed?

Open, probably.
It's only Daddy's money.

The cigarette.

Invented by
Alfonso Cigaretti in 1462.

I'm kidding. I don't...

I don't really know
who invented the cigarette.

You're kind of weird.

But kind of cute, too.

Well, then I'm
kind of offended,

but I'm also kind of flattered.

Here.

- Come on.
- Y-You know what?

It's for the best.

I've been trying to quit.

Well, maybe it's a sign.

Or maybe you just need
to get one that works.

This old thing?

Oh, it works.

That trust fund ingenue...

She was the right mark.

Don't know what
you're talking about.

Sure, you do.

You're going slow,
playing it safe,

not lifting too much at once.

I mean, stop me if I'm wrong.

Well, you're wrong.

And we're also closed,
so take off.

Victor Sullivan.
You can call me Sully.

Thank you.

I won't, but thank you.

I got a job coming up...
a big one.

I need another set
of hands on it.

So this is what you do?
You stumble into bars,

trying to pick up an accomplice?

I'm offering you
a real ticket out of here,

a chance to see places
you only read about in books.

What do you say?

You missed the read, Victor.

I'm not a mark in some bar.

And some of us here would
really like to go home, so...

get out.

Fair enough.

Bye-bye, now.

Hey, Goldie, let me get a beer.

Sure.

Son of a bitch.

Hey, hey, hey, get your head

- out of your ass.
- Whoa.

I'm so sorry.
I didn't see ya.

Hey.

I see patience
ain't your virtue.

Surprised to see me?

Not even slightly.
I made you a drink.

Shirley Temple.

That's hilarious.
And the bracelet?

It's in the first drawer there
on my desk,

if you want it.

But I think you're here 'cause
you got bigger fish to fry.

Nah, I'm just here
for the bracelet.

You done?

No.

Oof. This looks valuable.

Now I'm done.

Why the map?

Of everything in here,
that stopped you.

Because it looks like
it might be authentic.

Oh, not might be. It is.

Holy shit.

This line here shows the path

that Ferdinand Magellan took
to sail around the world.

First guy to do it.
You know your history.

Yeah, only he wasn't
the first guy to do it.

Magellan died
in the Philippines

on a random beach somewhere.

It was his captain,
Juan Sebastián Elcano,

finished the trip
with 17 others.

Also known as the Infamous 18.

I know the legend
that his voyage

wasn't about exploration...

it was about
finding that gold...

but it's just a story.

No. I beg to differ.

These trips were
hugely expensive back then.

The king of Spain
couldn't afford it.

There wasn't gonna be any trip

until a private financier
stepped in.

House of Moncada.

Yep.

Bankrolled the Crusades,
the Inquisition,

Franco's fascists in the '30s

and just about every horrible
thing you can think of.

They offered Magellan
his grand voyage of exploration

so long as he came back
with that gold.

How much gold?

Today's dollars...

Five billion, easy.

It's the biggest treasure
that's never been found.

Look, I've been dreaming
about this since I was a kid,

but somehow
you already knew that.

You know, when Sam said he had
a little brother who was

just as into
this Magellan stuff,

I thought, "There's no way."

Wait, you know my brother Sam?

Oh, we were
practically friends.

That's saying something,
considering the company I keep.

Look.

Look at him.

He has a beard.

Where is he?
When was this taken?

Almost two years ago,
San Sebastián, Spain.

We were getting close
to Captain Elcano's tomb,

where Sam was sure
we'd find his journal

and in it
the location of that gold.

Then he disappears.

Doesn't call, doesn't answer
my texts, nothing.

He ghosted me.

Yeah, that sounds
like my brother.

Oh, so he hasn't been in touch?

Sam? No.

Not even a postcard?

No, not a postcard, phone call,
text message, email, nothing.

Hey, look, I don't know
what happened between you two,

but I think
if we find that gold,

there's a real good chance
we find him, too.

What do you say?

Sam left when I was 10.

He would call
every once in a while,

swore he'd come back,
but he never did.

The Sam that I knew
disappeared a long time ago.

So, nah, you'll have to find
somebody else.

Wow.

I'm really losing my touch.

Wish you were here, bro.

There's a whole world
you haven't seen,

but you will.

I promise.

Hey, kid.

What took you so long?

So, when do we start?

There's an auction coming up.

Biggest collection
of Spanish Renaissance art

and artifacts
anywhere this century.

One of those items is
La Cruz de la Hermandad.

Only it's not a cross.

It's a key... a key that unlocks

the chamber where
the Infamous 18 hid their gold.

Very cool, but the legend said
there are two keys,

one for the captain
and one for the crew,

so no one man could steal
the gold by himself.

One key doesn't do us any good.

You ever get outside
when you were a kid?

I mean, how do you remember

all this shit?

Only one thing:

I already have
the captain's key.

Second one's in there.

The Augustine...
it's an auction house.

It's very exclusive,
but I got us on the list.

Look, all I need you to do is

kill the power
during the auction.

That'll trigger the main alarm,

- and then I can do my thing.
- Okay.

And how am I supposed
to kill the power?

Well, shit, that's up to you.
I mean, you got to bring

something to the equation.
I'm not cutting you in for fun.

Actually, that's a good point.

We haven't spoken
about my cut yet.

I assume we're 50-50, right?

Fifty-fif...?
On what, the gold?

- Yeah.
- Are you high?

You know this has been
years of my life?

You get ten percent,

- and that's me being generous.
- Wow.

That's awfully generous.

What are you gonna do
with that kind of money?

You still working on the tie?

I just can't figure out
the length.

I just keep making it all fat.

Come here.

You know what you're doing?

Yeah, my dad was a Navy man.

I could do this one-handed
with my eyes shut.

You served, too, didn't you?
Dishonorable discharge.

Hey, you did
some homework, huh?

- Of course I did.
- I flew helicopters.

I was preserving some artifacts
from a museum in Baghdad.

I was over the max load weight,
crashed pretty hard.

They got all upset,
kicked me out.

Bit of an overreaction,
but what are you gonna do?

You say "preserving,"

but you mean looting, right?

Well, if I didn't take 'em,
somebody else would've.

- You asked for that.
- Thank you.

And what's with the cat?

Oh, the cat?
She's just for you.

- What?
- Yeah.

Your life seemed super sad.

No, no, no, I'm not gonna
keep this thing.

They're gonna shit
all over my floor.

- Hey, wait for me.
- Hey.

These people can tell a fake
when they see one, all right?

You have to believe
the lie you're selling.

You belong here.
You're one of them.

Or you can just go with
the Bubblicious. Jesus.

No, this is Bubble Yum.

It's the same thing.
Here, put that in your ear.

No way.

Hello?

- Hello?
- I can hear you.

I'm sitting right next to you.

Oh, shit, I think
I pushed it in too far.

- Is it okay?
- Let's go.

Oof.

Look at that car.

Bet that ain't cheap.

Shit. Santiago Moncada.

- Like the House of Moncada?
- Yeah.

He thinks the cross is his
by birthright.

If he buys it
before we can grab it,

you kiss that gold goodbye.

Welcome, sir.
What can I get you?

You know what,
I'll have a martini.

Yes, sir.

- A martini?
- Yeah. Why not?

That'll go great
with the bubble gum.

You should actually put
the gum in the martini.

You'd have
a bubble gum martini.

- That's actually not a bad idea.
- Yeah.

My God, this girl is
totally flirting with me.

- Where?
- There.

The woman with Moncada.

Look, she's flirting
with me. Hi.

It's not flirting, all right?
Not with you.

That is Jo Braddock.
You ever see her coming,

you need to run the other way.
I'm serious.

She's coming this way now.
Look.

Yeah, then you know what to do.

You'll thank me later.

Hello, Victor.

Oh, what's the matter?

Feelings still hurt
after San Sebastián?

You're something else.

So, what ridiculous scheme
have you cooked up this time?

Well, if I tell you,
it'll ruin the surprise.

Well, you do tend
to ruin everything, don't you?

I'm not the one
working for Moncada.

I mean, that's low...
even for you, Jo.

Whatever gets me
the gold, right?

Well, you taught me that,
Victor.

Increíble.

Whoa, Jesus.

Oh, sorry.

It's pretty cool, huh?

Well, it's a one-of-a-kind
solid-gold altar crucifix.

Handcrafted in Barcelona
in the early 16th century,

so it's... yes, yeah,
it's pretty cool, yeah.

Wow. You know your crosses.

My family has been looking for
this one for a very long time.

No way.

So have I.

Y-You are a collector?

I dabble.

I don't dabble.

This cross has
a very tragic history.

18 men died
trying to hold on to it.

So much blood
so needlessly spilled.

Ladies and gentlemen,

if I could have
your attention, please.

Good luck to you.

Would you
please take your seats?

The auction will be
commencing very soon.

Hey, Bubble Yum.

You done chatting up
our archnemesis?

I'm pretty sure he just
threatened to kill me.

Don't touch your ear like that.
You look like an idiot.

Get a move on.

Now, most of you

may be well aware
of the fact that...

Gonna make my way upstairs.

...are made from some of

the most exciting items,

many of which
are exceedingly rare,

from our Spanish Renaissance
collection.

Uh,
your girlfriend seems pissed.

Is that something
I should be worried about?

Just stay focused.

So, once again...

Keep an eye on him for me.

...if you would, please come

and take your seats.

Thank you very much.

Excuse me.

Okay, let's get started, then,
with lot number one.

A magnificent oil on copper,

"Our Lady of Good Counsel"
by Bartolomé Pérez.

Hello?

600,000, going once,
going twice...

Sold to the lady in the back.

Thank you very much.

The cross is up next, kid.

Um...

Sully, don't worry.

I got it.

Ow.

La Cruz de la Hermandad.

Now, most of you will know
this was made in Barcelona

circa 16th century.

It is truly a gorgeous piece

and representative of
Spanish Renaissance gold work.

So, we're gonna start off
tonight's bidding at 200,000.

Do I have 200,000 in the room?

Thank you very much.

I have an opening bid
of 200,000 from Mr. Moncada.

Okay. Here we go.

Do I hear four?

How we doing?

We're doing great.

500,000 it is. Do I have six?

I have six.
Thank you very much, madam.

- I don't have all night.
- Do I have seven?

700,000 from Mr. Moncada.

Do we have eight?

No takers?

So, fair warning on 700,000.

That is 700, going once...

Don't make me do this.

...700, going twice.

And...

There we are
at the back of the room.

Thank you very much, sir.
We have 800,000.

800,000 is the bid, ladies
and gentlemen. Do I have nine?

I'm spending
money I don't have.

Okay. Here goes nothing.

Oh, God!

Ya shouldnae come out to play
with the big boys, wee'un,

'cause you're about to get
a proper Scottish welcome.

I'm sorry?

Mr. Moncada,
it's back to you now... 1.9.

Mr. Moncada makes it
an even $2 million,

ladies and gentlemen.

Well, train's already left
the station, right? Why not?

2.1. Thank you
very much, indeed.

Mr. Moncada, over to you.

Any advances on that?

2.2. We have 2.2,
ladies and gentlemen.

Oh, God, here she comes.

I said ya shouldnae come out
to play with the big boys,

wee'un, 'cause you're about to
get a proper Scottish welcome!

Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

I literally have no idea
what you're saying.

You little...

2.2 is what we have.

Do I have 2.3? He goes with it.

Mr. Moncada takes it
to $3 million.

Stupid door.

Okay. Um...

Oh, God.

Sully, I think you're just
gonna have to buy that cross.

Fair warning.

$3 million it is, going once...

You better do something now.

Kill the power,
fake a heart attack...

I don't give a shit.

...going twice...

And...

Ah, this is gonna suck!

Get back here!

Get on him! Come on, come on!

Well, that was something.

- What's your plan now?
- Well, at least you fat-asses

can't come out here and get me.

There is a small situation,

but I'm sure
we'll have it sorted out

- in just a second.
- Come on, careful.

Can we secure the cross, please?

- Thank you very much.
- Grab him

by the trousers
and get him by the balls!

Security, can you go down

and find out
exactly what's going on?

You're doing great.
Hang in there.

Oh... Oh, shit.

Oh, my God. Are you okay?

Hey, Trent, Addison wanted me

to take that
to the vault pronto.

- Okay.
- Thanks.

Everybody, remain calm.

Sully, where you going?
You can't leave me.

There's only one rule
in this game, kid:

Don't get caught.

Excuse me, sir. We need
to ask you a few questions.

I think that's a little rude.
I think I should be

asking you the questions,
if I'm honest.

Actually, you know what?
I'm-a do you one better.

I'm-a get my lawyer
to ask the questions,

starting with:
Who installed that handrail?

I mean, look at that thing.

- Hey!
- Hey, get back here! Hey!

Even more ridiculous
than I could have imagined.

I don't know. I think it was
going pretty well so far.

Funny.

I think that belongs to me.

Jo, come on.

Save it, Victor.

- Save...
- Oh, thank God.

Guys, she's trying
to steal the cross.

Just put down the case
and step aside.

Yeah, put down my case.

Step aside.

I'll get this
to where it belongs.

Good luck.

All right, lady.
Stay calm, all right?

Sorry sons of bitches.

All right, let's get
out of here, Tony.

Hey. You surprised to see me?

Well, you proved yourself
again, kid.

That was some swan dive
you took.

You were just gonna
leave me back there.

Well, it wouldn't do any good
having us both locked up.

Somebody had to get the cross.

Holy shit, you got it.

Hey, maybe I should
hold on to that for...

What, you don't trust me?

Oh, is that supposed
to be funny?

Here.

Tony, take us to Teterboro.

Unless you want to get
dropped off somewhere else.

Oh, yeah, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

Sorry, Sully, but I'm all in.

Hey, Tony, Teterboro.

Wow.
Captain's journal. This is amazing.

There's some crazy shit in
there, huh?

It's unbelievable. I mean,
it totally confirms the legend.

Magellan did find tons of gold
in the Philippines.

They hid the gold in Barcelona

and then told the Moncadas
that the trip was a bust.

Okay, well, you have any bright
ideas on how to use the keys?

Yeah, here.
The captain wrote,

"The path begins in Barcelona
where the keys turn into pine."

And then there's a sketch here
of a pine tree. Here.

So we're looking for a tree.

- Really?
- Yeah.

Wow.
That's your expert analysis?

Well, you just gave me the book
like an hour ago.

What am I supposed to do?

I mean,
I got that far on my own.

I've seen the picture
of the tree. Where's the gold?

Is it under the tree?
Is it in the tree?

- I don't know. Could be.
- Look out the window.

There's a lot of trees
in Barcelona.

All right,
anything you need in Barcelona,

Chloe Frazer can get it.

I didn't tell her
about you yet, but she's cool.

Hey, Chlo.

Who the hell is this?

I'm Nate.
I'm a friend of Sully's.

Sully doesn't have any friends.

I should know.
I'm one of them.

That's not true.
People love me.

And what's with the spy games?

Why couldn't we meet
at the house?

I was making sure
you weren't followed.

Come on, you don't think
I can spot a tail?

Mate, I've been on you
since the airport.

Really? All the way
from the airport?

Look, it doesn't matter.

Why is he here?

Why am I...?
Why are you here?

Clearly, you didn't tell him.

Chloe has the other cross.

- What?
- Did I not mention that?

- No, you didn't.
- Are you sure? Well, look,

- it's mine, basically, all right?
- Okay.

So we're all gonna be
partners on this thing.

That's the way it's happening,
so get used to it.

No, we're not.

Look, word to the unwise...

everything
out of this one's mouth

is an exaggeration,
a half-truth

- or an outright lie.
- You know what?

That is not true.

See ya, Sully.

That's... Come on, Chlo.

She'll come back.
She has to.

I don't think
she's coming back.

So?

- Where's the cross?
- It's in my bag.

Check your bag. Do it now.

Shit.

You let her take the cross?
You let her take the cross.

- Shit.
- You better get that cross back!

You got to be kidding me.
What a rookie mistake.

- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa!

- Could you move any slower?!
- I got a bad ankle, kid.

I can't be
running around out here.

Oh, shit!

Move!

Out of the way!
Move, move, move!

Move!

Listen! You don't know where
you're going with them keys!

Look, you're looking
for a tree, right?

Piss off.

Listen to me.

The 18 were willing to wait
years to go back for the gold.

They wouldn't have picked
a tree as a marker.

They would have picked
something more permanent.

You're full of shit.

Hey.

Let her go.

She knows where
to use the keys,

then she doesn't need us,
right?

Okay. Be my guest.
Get out of here.

Thank you.

Bye.

If it's not a tree, what is it?

At the auction house, Moncada
called it an "altar crucifix."

I didn't think about it then,
but it means that the cross

was originally made
to stand on an altar.

In a church.

Which church?

God, you guys never stop,
do you?

Look, if we want
to get the gold,

we're gonna have to figure out
a way to trust each other.

So give me the key.

Which church?

Santa Maria del Pi.

Saint Mary of the Pine.

This has to be it.

You might just be a genius.

"Genius" is a stretch.

Oh, yeah? Look at that.

Now you know why I brought him.

Hmm.

Okay. Good work.

I'll go see when we might have
a private look inside.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't even think about it.

- What?
- Well, you don't catch on

too quick, do you?
She's not to be trusted.

You met her for two minutes,

she already stole
the cross from you.

She's coming back.

There's a midnight mass
tonight,

so tomorrow's the earliest
we can poke around.

You got our gear at the
house, right?

Yeah. Come on.

Father.

You said we were going to
discuss this.

I changed my mind.

I'm allowed.

It's not yours to give.

You built none of it - they did.

Our fortune is dipped in blood.

And giving it all away
will release that stain?

I should have cut you off
years ago.

Ms. Braddock.

Welcome to Barcelona
as my ancestors knew it.

Quite something, isn't it?

Yes, it's truly
an impressive excavation.

Yeah.

This competitor of yours,
Victor Sullivan...

maybe he's the one
I should have hired.

Victor Sullivan is
a liar and a fraud.

Any deal you make with him
is worthless.

Perhaps.

But I've been told, uh,

he was seen
in the Barrio Gótico.

Maybe you should look into it.

Yes, sir.

Good.

I found my cross
in a crypt in Genoa,

but I didn't know it was a key
to a much bigger fortune.

Sully knew.

Doesn't say what happens
after we turn the keys.

"Trust in your fellow man,
for one will

go to heaven
and the other to hell."

Well, it's ironic,

seeing as the only point
in having two keys

was that the 18
didn't trust each other.

Well, good thing they didn't,
or we wouldn't be here, right?

Like one big happy family.

Toast?

All right.

Arriba, abajo,
al centro y pa' dentro.

Hey, kid, slow down.

That's a vintage rioja,
all right?

You might want to just
taste it, savor it.

Or chug it down
like you're on spring break.

All good.

I'm onto you, you know.

Sully.

What?

He's Sam's brother, isn't he?

Oh, wow, you cracked the case.
Great job.

Does he know what happened?

Not yet.

I-I'm gonna tell him.

When?

Who's still thirsty?

I found another bottle of red.

Hey, kid, you think she's okay?

- Who?
- My cat.

You have a cat?

The man from the app said
he was gonna feed her,

but he didn't text me back yet.

I don't know what's cuter...
your concern

or the fact that you just said
"the man from the app."

Stop.

Do you come here to
ruin the one place I find peace?

Father,

you can't
give it away.

Tell me it's not too late.

You can't change my mind.

I'm making the arrangements.

This scavenger hunt is over.

Padre.

Do you really
have no faith in me?

In Him I have faith.

Who the hell are you?

Get out of my car!

Santiago, what are you doing?

Forgive me,

Father.

Oh, great.

Nuns. Why's it always
got to be nuns?

All right, let's just split up
and figure out

where the keys go, huh?

Okay.

Never
thought I'd be back in church,

but this one's special.

Hey, Sully.

What?

Nothing.

Hey, guys.

Come here.

Look.

"JSE."

Juan Sebastián Elcano.

The 18 were here all right.

Look, if that's the cathedral,

then these must be the stairs,

and they lead...

that way.

Thoughts, altar boy?

"Caelum." That's,
um, Latin for "heaven."

Says in the journal,
"Trust in your fellow man,

for one shall go to heaven,
the other to hell."

So, if heaven's up there,

then hell has to be
around here somewhere.

I hope.

Hey, I got a skeleton
with angel wings.

That's kind of between
heaven and hell, right?

Does Mary look
a little off to you?

Yeah.

No way.

Hey. Come on, open it up.

I'm not gonna do that.
We're in a church, man.

Come on, have some respect.

Scared of a little old nun?

Well, you haven't met
Sister B, have you?

Hold that.

Here.

Okay.

Well, there's hell.

Whoa!

Holy shit. You found 'em.

Hey, what does that
look like to you?

A keyhole.

Wait, which way should we turn,
left or right?

I don't know.
Uh, what does the book say?

Um... oh, right here.

Both-both of you, uh,

turn your keys clockwise
at the same time.

Three, two, one.

Turn.

Shit!

Thanks a lot.
You almost got me killed.

Clockwise, Sully?

Well, it was 50-50,
so I made a guess.

A guess?
That could've been our heads!

Well, clearly, you should turn
the keys the other way.

Kid, I don't even
have my glasses.

I can't read this shit.

Yeah, clearly.

Just be careful, all right?

You're gonna get
somebody killed.

Okay, come on.

Counterclockwise.

Just look away from it.

Ready? Here we go.

Three, two, one.

Turn.

Whoa!

Look at that. I was right
the second time, huh?

Like, an opening back here.

You want to help, Sully?

Oh, kid, I'm watching our back.

What if the nun comes down
to get you?

Chloe?

There you go.

All right,
we're making some progress.

- Let's go.
- No, wait.

Hang on.
What does the book say?

Uh, heaven and hell. One of us
goes up, the other goes down.

- Exactly. I'll go down.
- Yeah, I'll come with you.

- Really?
- What?

- Well, that was quick.
- What are you talking about?

What, are you just gonna

follow her down there
like a puppy dog?

What, you want me
to come with you,

- hold your hand?
- You know what?

It's fine. Give me your cross.

Not giving you my cross.
Why would I do that?

'Cause I'm probably gonna
need it up there.

You have your girlfriend's
cross, don't you?

You don't need 'em both.

Okay, good point.
Well, give me your phone.

- No.
- Sully, just give me your phone.

- For what?
- What, you don't trust me?

I don't trust anybody.

I thought
I told you that already.

Thank you.

I thought you knew better.

Oh, my God.

You have so many apps open.

What is wrong with you?

Tinder?

- Really?
- I-I own that.

Okay. Now you can track us.

Try and stay
on top of us, okay?

- There you go.
- Have fun in the haunted tunnel.

- Yeah.
- Enjoy.

Oh, we will.

This is amazing.

I mean, we're the first ones
down here in 500 years.

Find the other two.

I've got Sully.

Aye.

Hey, I got an arrow
pointing this way.

The Eye of Providence.

I say we go with God.

But there's literally an arrow
that points this way.

Suit yourself.

But the arrow.

I'm gonna go this way.

Yeah, we should go your way.
We should go your way.

Um...

Ah, great. Here we go again.

Do you want to work your magic?

So, uh, when did you decide
to become Indiana Jones?

When I was a kid,
I liked to go exploring.

One day, I found
a bronze statue covered in gems

buried under a bridge.

I'll never forget the feeling,
you know?

I ran and showed it
to my father.

I thought he'd put it
in a museum.

But instead, he sold it.

He kept all the money.

We never saw him again.

Wow, that sucks. I'm sorry.

Why? I'm better for it.

Here. I got just the tool.

You see that?

Sure, when the big bad nun's
not around.

Does this look right to you?

Well, I don't really know
what the path

to ancient treasure's
supposed to look like.

- More ancient?
- I guess.

Hey, Sully, do you see
anything weird up there?

You're gonna have
to be more specific.

Do you hear that?

What the hell?

Hey,
what's going on down there?

Hey, this can't be right,
can it?

I can't hear one
thing you're saying.

Come on, let's go.

Yeah, this definitely
doesn't look right.

Look, above the bar.

"Infernum."
Isn't that Latin for "hell"?

Yeah, it is. Come on.

Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

- It's Braddock's backup.
- What?

We better keep moving.

- What are you doing?
- Blending in.

Yeah, it's not a bad idea.

Hey, listen, I'm not really
much of a dancer.

- Let's go.
- Okay.

Hey, two Commonwealths.

Okay.

What are you doing?

I'm causing a distraction.

Oh, for God's sake.

Do you think
it's another puzzle?

Well, whatever it is,
you better figure it out fast.

I'm-a try and buy us some time.

- Hey, can I get you a drink?
- Gin and tonic, por favor.

This definitely
isn't a gin and tonic,

but it is on the house.

Gracias.

Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
let me guess.

Piña colada?

The Eye.

You think you're a comedian,
do you, sunshine?

Okay, I got it, I got it.

Sex on the Beach.

Nate!

Oh, shit.

Nate, this is not a time
for shots. Let's go!

God, those guys suck.

Where the hell are we?

Well, well, well.

Look for a way out.

Think I found one.

Uh, almost caught up.

Hey, you got that key?

Yeah.

- Water.
- A lot of water.

Oh, my God.

Um, this has to be a test.

The 18 must have built
an escape, right?

What did the journal say again?

Uh, it said,
"Trust in your fellow man,

for one shall go to heaven,
the other to hell."

"Trust in your fellow man,
for one..."

- Sully!
- Sully! Uh, Sully!

There has to be another keyhole

up there somewhere
that opens this door!

I'm, like, literally
in a Papa Johns right now.

Sully,
we're running out of time!

I found it.

Excuse me, guys.

I'm gonna need a minute.

Sully, we do not have a minute!

Hand it over, Victor.

Oh, shit!

Give me the cross.

Come on, Jo.

You know I can't do that.

You haven't said "please."

Now.

Okay.

Didn't I tell you
you should've said "please"?

Oh, come on, Sully.
After all we've been through?

Sully! Hurry!

Shut up. I'm working on it.

I'll shut up when you get us

the hell out of here.

Oh, sh...

What's going on?!

Sully,
if you don't turn that damn key,

we're gonna drown.

It's gonna take a little longer
than I thought, kid.

You got to help me.

Gonna try to get
this grate up, okay?

Okay.

I can't believe you walked out
on me, you son of a bitch.

Why? Did you miss me?

Sully!
It's now or never, buddy!

We're running out
of options down here!

Nate, look at me.

- We can do this.
- Okay.

- We can do this.
- Deep breaths.

Did you miss this, Victor? Hmm?

Chloe!

Chloe.

Chloe, please. Come on!

Okay.

It's okay.

Here, I'm gonna lift you out.

Hey, guys. Say something.

Tell me you're alive.

Yeah, we're good.

We're still alive.

All right, then what are you
waiting for? Get a move on.

Thank you.

You had it.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

- You good?
- Yeah.

Hey, Sully, you still up there?

I'm here. What do you got?

Not much.
It's dark as hell in here.

I always wanted to try this.

You need to give
that thing up already.

Oh, come on.

Ha.

See? That's all I ask.

Little faith.

I see a light. Is that you?

Yeah, that's us.

We're in some sort of...

Roman antechamber.

Whoa.

Hey, you got that key?

Thank you.

Okay.

No, it doesn't fit.

Sully.

Okay.

Sully, we're missing something.

See if you can find
anything up there.

I can't get the grate up.

Forget the grate and look.

I see something.

Looks like a ladder
or something.

I think I get it.

I think it's the two keys
put together.

What?

I said I think it's
the two keys put together.

Throw your key down!

Hey. You two think
you're gonna double-cross me?

Hey, Sully, you want the stupid
key, or you want the gold?

Come on, this is it.
Throw it down.

I'm coming down there for this.

You hear me?

You ain't gonna play me.

Typical Sully.

He'd rather
lose the gold than...

Thank you.

Does that look
like a ladder to you?

Yeah.

Okay, ready?

Three, two, one.

Did you see that?

What are you waiting for?

Whoa. What the...?

- What's happening?
- We found it.

Is the gold there? Talk to me.

We're in an old
Roman storehouse.

It's got to be
at least 2,000 years old,

and there are these giant urns
that are like eight feet tall.

Are they intact?

Yeah, they're perfectly
preserved.

So, what are you waiting for?
Open them up and get the gold.

Give me a lift.

Here we go.
Three, two, one. Go.

Okay. Are you okay?

Yeah, yeah.

Okay.

Okay.

- You good?
- Yeah.

You see anything?

Uh...

Chloe?

Salt.

Chloe? I think
we have a problem.

Chloe?

They used salt
to store food, but...

I don't know why they'd put...

- What's happening?
- No.

It's got to be here.

Yeah, or why all the tricks?

Answer me, guys.
What do you got?

The gold's not here.

Oh, my God.

What? What is it?

They never brought it back.

The path to the gold
starts here in Barcelona,

but it ends somewhere over here
in the East Indies.

Hey, Chloe.

Give it to me.

You're kidding, right?

I'm not getting screwed
on this one.

Pick up the map
and give it to me.

Nate, what's going on
down there?

Slowly.

Hey, tell me what's happening.

Sully, I got this.

Look, you don't
have to do this, okay?

Don't...

try anything.

You can trust me.

Just put the gun down.

You have no idea who
you're partnered with, do you?

You don't even really know
what went down.

Went down with what?

Sam.

Who do you think?

What are you talking about?

Ask Sully.

No, no, no, no, no. No.

Chloe, please tell me
what happened to my brother.

Please.

You're a good guy, Nate.

Too good.

Hey, Nate.

Wake up.

Got you pretty good, huh?

I tried to warn you about her,

but you didn't want
to listen, did you?

What happened to my brother?

Stop thinking of the next lie
you're gonna tell me.

Where's Sam, Sully?

I should've told you before.

But your brother...

he's gone, kid.

No, he's not.
You said he ghosted you.

He's gone.
He didn't ghost me.

We went down to
the captain's tomb together

to find the journal.

And it was there, right where
Sam said it would be.

We were on our way out,
and Braddock and her guys,

they cut us off.

They opened fire, and...

and Sam got shot.

So you just
left him there to die.

I saw a way out, so I took it.

So you just
left him there to die.

What was I supposed to do,
get shot, too?

Nothing I could do.

How could you not tell me this?

Well, I knew if I told you, you
never would've come with me.

And why is that
so important, huh?

The hell am I doing here
and not somebody else?

Your brother believed
that there was a final piece.

All right?
A last trick the 18 played.

I thought maybe
he said something to you

or sent you something.
I mean, shit, all he ever did

- was talk about you.
- So that's what this is about.

You dragged me
all the way out here,

let me believe that I might
see my brother again

because you think
that I know something?

Yeah.

Do you?

Did you really
just ask me that?

You said that money
changes people...

makes them greedy,
makes them selfish...

but you know what I think?

I think that's just
who you are.

I don't think there was ever
a better version of you.

And whatever this is...

now I'm done.

Kid.

Mr. Moncada.

We've run into
some difficulties.

The gold was never here
beneath the city.

Yeah, I know.

It's quite embarrassing, huh?

I believe there was a clue
left down there,

and we know who has it:
a Miss Chloe Frazer.

My people are out
looking for her now...

Oh, you mean the big guy
who doesn't talk

and his sidekick,
the Highlander?

Yeah, they didn't find me.

Diversified investment.

I hired Miss Frazer
the same day I hired you.

Of course, she will lead
the operation from here on out.

I haven't forgotten my promise.

Remember, if something's lost,

it can be found.

I know where she took the map.

Moncada.

Right? I mean, think about it.

Who else is gonna have
the resources she's gonna need?

And Braddock and her goon squad

just so happened to find us
at the church?

He had to have somebody
on the inside.

You hate me.
All right, I get it.

Look, I'd hate me, too.

But Braddock, after what
she did to your brother?

She shot him in cold blood.

All right?
We can't let her win. She...

Oh, Sully,
will you please just stop

trying to play me
for like five minutes?

For years, I told myself
that Sam would come back.

That he wasn't gone,
that he was just lost.

But instead,
I'm stuck here with you,

so this is how
this is gonna go.

I'm gonna finish
what my brother started,

and then we go
our separate ways.

All right.

It's a deal, kid.

Hey.

Be careful when you load her.

I don't want her
getting scratched.

Yes, sir.

Nice car.

Yeah.

My father gave me this car
when I turned 18.

It's been my good-luck charm
ever since.

The map.

You know...

it's natural
to feel some conflict.

You made a difficult decision
but the right one.

I don't really do regret.

Neither do I.

Shall we?

When you're right,
you're right, huh?

You don't have to
apologize to me now.

She only cut us out
because she knew

you were gonna cut her out.

You're still harboring feelings

for that girl who knocked you
on your ass, huh?

Wow.

Let's go!
Move it in, lock it down!

All right, come on.

They're getting ready to go.

Maravilloso.

Now, who is ready to make
a little history?

I overlaid the map
with modern satellite imagery.

We'll drop our supplies
from the air,

land in Kiamba, Philippines,

where we'll be met
by our local forces.

We should find the pot
at the end of the rainbow here,

in Cala de Oro.

Vámonos.

Approaching drop zone.

Lowering cargo door.

To the victor...

the spoils.

Ah, come on. Give it to them.

500 years ago,
my family was betrayed.

Yes, a small band of explorers,

they found
the world biggest fortune.

And you know what? They hid it.

Uh, for centuries,
people search for it,

all in vain.

It was left to me

to recover my family's gold.

Nobody thought I could do it.

And certainly not my...
my father.

Now, today...

is the day I restore
the Moncadas' fortune.

And I bring honor
back to my house.

And I earn my place in...

Daddy was right...
you don't have what it takes.

The House of Moncada
dies with you.

Where's Frazer?

No loose ends.

That was literally
the worst ten hours of my life.

You want to get caught,
just keep talking.

Oh, good job, Jo.

Oh, shit.

It's hard to find a good
partner in this game, huh?

Well, maybe you'll learn
to appreciate me

a little bit more.

All right, let's find
some parachutes.

- Parachutes? What?
- Unless you know a better way

to jump out of a plane.

It looks like
the lassie's boosted.

Hey. Don't even think about it.

I can't just let her
get away with it.

This is not the place
to pick a fight, okay?

I'm trying to protect you.

Put one of these on.
Let's go now.

Hey!

Did you kill my brother?

I said, did you kill
my brother, Sam Drake?

Nate! Come on!

Whoa.

Whoa!

Oh, God!

Hey, Braddock!
We found your loose end.

Now get rid
of her.

Oh, crap!

We can patch this up, Frazer.

Drop the gun.

I don't think
you've been counting.

You've only got one shot left.

I got to give it to you,
Frazer.

A fighter to the bitter end.

This is a very bad idea.

But this is the end.

Whoa!

- Nate?
- Oh, come on!

What the hell are you doing?!

You just hit me with a car!

- You don't have a parachute?
- You don't have a parachute!

- Follow me!
- What?

Come on.

Whoa! Oh, shit!

Pull the cord!

Nate, come on!

I'm trying!

Hold on. Hold on!

I'm not gonna apologize,

if that's what
you're waiting for.

I could probably forgive you

for what you did in Barcelona.

Maybe even for knocking me
out of a plane with a car.

But Braddock? Really?

You really think
there's any difference

between them and you?

You and Sully were
just as eager

to screw me over as they were.

Look, I'm not Sully, okay?

Hallelujah.

One's bad enough.

Nate?

Do you see what I'm seeing?

Well, if what you're seeing is
endless open ocean, then yeah.

Holy shit.

Whoa.
What the hell happened to you two?

Fell out of a car
that fell out of a plane.

Huh. Hey, you know, something
like that happened to me once.

Ah. Okay.

Good luck.

And here is your card back,
Mr. Sullivan.

Please, call me Victor.

Come on, I spent ten hours
in a trunk with him.

I couldn't help myself.

Let me show you to your room.

Thank you.

Moncada's money has
bought us everything we need.

All right, let's get to work.

Hey there.

- Hey.
- What are you doing?

Are you sure these dimensions
are the same as the actual map?

To the exact millimeter. Why?

Braddock isn't gonna
find the gold.

Well, not where
she's looking, anyway.

You mean we still
have a chance?

The captain left
one final clue,

and Sully seems to think that
Sam knew what that clue was,

and he might have tried
to tell me what it was.

These postcards
are the only thing

I've got from Sam
in the last ten years,

so if he did try
to tell me something, it...

has to be in these cards.

For the love of God,
please be trying

to tell me something, Sam.

Is it something in the images?

Or something in the writing.

Like an anagram or a cipher.

We used to do that
all the time as kids.

Well, let's start
with the images.

- Do blue.
- Colors.

- There's a lot of blue.
- Okay, okay.

Um... There's one card

where he spells
everything wrong.

- Weird.
- Where is that?

- T-H-A-R...
- Um...

- Hills.
- H-Hills?

Hills.

So try writing, uh, this out.

- "Wish you were here, bro."
- "Wish you were here..."

And then for every
letter you write down,

find the corresponding letter.

So, "Wish you were here, bro."

I'm gonna go to sleep.

Come on, Sam.

What are you trying to tell me?

What are you trying
to tell me, buddy?

"There's a whole world you
haven't seen, but you will."

"There's a whole world
you haven't seen..."

"Haven't seen."

Okay, come on.
Come on, come on.

"There's a whole world you
haven't seen, but you will.

Promise. Sam."

"The keys are your compass."
"The keys are your compass."

"The key..."

Okay, okay, okay.

Some compass, my ass.

Holy shit.

Blue goes there.

And red goes there.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God. Chloe.

Okay.

- Get out.
- Okay. Jump.

- Let's go.
- Not bad.

Very good.

Chloe?

I'm sorry, Nate.

I like you. I really do.

But I learned the hard way

the minute you start
to trust someone, you lose.

Yeah, well...

too bad you're headed
in the wrong direction.

What the hell?

Lost. Not gone.

There's a difference.

If something's lost,

it can be found.

We did it, Sam.

We did it.

Cloves.

You know, back then,
spices were worth

nearly as much as gold.

Why am I not surprised?

I keep too many apps open,
remember?

- I knew you'd figure it out.
- Figure what out?

The puzzle in Sam's postcards.

- So, what is it?
- Does it matter?

I already found the gold.

I don't see any gold.

Oh, it's here.

It's a false top.

Old pirate trick.

Here's your gold
you've been looking for.

You happy now?

Holy shit.

You got to be kidding me.

Well, look at that, huh?

It's almost more than we
thought. Plus the other ship.

Plus the value
of the ships themselves,

which you can't even
put a price on.

We did it!
We actually did it!

Sully, we didn't do anything.

Okay? There is no "we."
There's only you.

Because there's not
a person in your life

that you wouldn't betray
for a piece of this.

You made that real clear.

I thought
that's what we wanted.

No, I wanted to do this
with my brother Sam,

not with you.

I know.

I'm sorry.

But look around, kid.
You did this.

He'd be proud of you.

- It's Braddock.
- Shit.

We'd better get small.

- Or, in your case, smaller.
- Hey.

You're only like one inch
taller than me, max.

I think it's a little more
than that, kid.

Come with me.
I know where to go.

Magellan's ships.

Oh, they're more beautiful than
I could have ever imagined.

Find the gold.
If you see Sully,

do not let him open
that mouth of his.

Kill him and Drake on sight.

- Aye.
- Be careful, gentlemen.

These ships are worth a fortune
on their own.

You put a hole in my boats,
I put a hole in you.

- Oh, I'm not going in there.
- Hey, look.

You could stay up here
and get shot in the head

or come down here
for a quick cuddle... up to you.

- I'm going down.
- Oh, God.

You see anything?

All clear, sir.

Braddock.

We cannae find them.

They're nae on board.

They must have filled
their pockets and fled.

Keep an eye out anyway.

Sully's a cockroach
when it comes to gold.

Wind is
one-five-zero-one-five-nine.

Hold TRQ at 4.2.

All right, who's clear?

What is it with you
and small spaces?

Got this
thing jamming up my ass.

- Wow.
- Don't even think about it.

Oh, I'm thinking about it.

Oh, my God.

All right, come on.

Oh, Jesus.
She's flying the ships out?

And us with them.

What do you mean,
she's flying us out?

Victoria, this is Trinidad.

Are you ready to receive? Over.

Roger that.
Victoria standing by.

Let's bring her home.

You ready up there, Scotty?

Aye.

Hold TRQ at 4.2.

Two degrees south.

Geez, Sully, come on.
The boat's full of that stuff.

Just in case.

No.

Hey. You want to go show 'em
what's what?

That's nice.
Let me see it for a second.

- Yeah, nice, huh?
- Yeah, real nice.

Hey.

Holding steady.

You ready for a mutiny?

Why not?

Whoa!

Whoa!

Oh, shit.

That one's a little more
your size.

Yeah, cute.

Whoa, whoa, whoa! Not my gold!

Oh, shit.

Okay, you go to go hijack
that helicopter.

Right to the point, huh?
All right.

You know the drill, right?
You don't have to touch it

with your finger to use it.

Hey, Sully.

- Don't crash.
- Just what I needed.

Positive reinforcement. Thanks.

Hey! All hands on deck!

Raise the anchor!
Hoist the mainsail!

Hey, Jack Sparrow, stay sharp.

Oh, come on, man,
I've been waiting to do this

my entire life.

Hey, guys.

Hey!

All right, Victor, you got this.

Come on.

Easy.

Hey, Jo.

Follow that ship.

Hey, Sully, I think your
girlfriend wants her boat back.

Yeah, I'm aware.

- Try to get the...
- Load 'em up!

- Go!
- Go!

Come on.

- Clear!
- Go!

All right,
let's see what this shitcan can do.

Shite!

Hang on, kid.
I'm-a get us out of here.

Okay. Okay.

Gunpowder.

Look at that.

There we go.

Come on, baby.

I think that did it.

I still got it.

Oh, shit.

Hey, you still with me?

Barely.

Yes!

You got to do something.

They're coming right at us.

I think I have an idea.

Okay.

What's going on?!

Sully, will you please
just shut up?

I'm working on it. Okay.

That's your idea?

No.

Ah, come on!

No, no, no, no.

No, no, no.

Oh, God!

Oh, shite!

What a shot!

Mother Mary!

We're home free.

You did it, kid.
You did it.

Yeah, Sully!

If I lose, so do you.

Hey, Sully, this ain't over.

Damn it!

What's going on?

Come on, we're so close!

Ah, shit!

No, no, no!

No!

Damn!

Say hi to your brother
for me, will you?

You first.

Sully!

Sully, no!

Please!

Shit.

Hey, Braddock!

Nate! Come on!

Trust me.

I got you, kid. I got you.

Come on.

Look at her.

You can't put a price on that.

Yeah, you can, actually.

Like four to six billion.

We could just get
a diving rig.

Not before those guys.

It's property
of the Philippines now.

Hey. I just wanted
to say thank you

for what you did for me
back there.

You know, ever since
my brother Sam left...

Oh, you... Oh.

Can you hear me?

- I can now.
- I was...

I was just saying
we should get out of here.

You got it.

Hey.

Is that who I think it is?

Bastards.

Yeah, I might have let her
steal the wrong coordinates.

Hey, you're starting
to figure it out, kid.

Yeah, I learned from the best.

You got a heart of gold, Sully.

Real funny, wiseass.

- What, too soon?
- Forever is too soon.

Here, maybe this will help.
I got you something.

Are you kidding me, kid?
For real?

Yeah, look. I got this...

You got to be kidding me.

- ...and these.
- You got more?

- I got loads of it. Look.
- Oh.

Keep it coming.

You'll like this one.

Here you go. Here you go.

Aw.

This means a lot to me.

That was my last piece, man.

Come on, let's just
get out of here.

All right, hang on.

- You're late.
- Sorry about that.

Why do you want the map?

I'll tell you...

if you tell me
what Roman wants with my ring.

Because he knows it means
something special to you.

Okay, let's have it.

Now... you're gonna tell me
what's so important

about an old Nazi map.

Hey. Put 'em down, boys.

Nice and slow.

What...

What is that thing
on your face?

Hey, puberty's
right around the corner, kid.

You can grow your own.

You got what you want.

And I got what I want.

Montecristo. I'm impressed.

You're gonna be dead
before you can smoke it.

Hey, it's always a pleasure
doing business with you.

And, um...
would you look at that?

I got friends everywhere,
Drake.

Oh, yeah?
I can't wait to meet 'em.

Hey, you were supposed
to be here yesterday.

Did you know you need
special papers

to bring an animal on a plane?

- I did not know that.
- You trying to tell me

I almost just bought it because
you brought your damn cat?

Hey, I go everywhere with
Mr. Whiskers, okay?

Let me see the map.

This is the big one, kid.

- You ready?
- Yeah.

Let's go.

Oh, crap.
