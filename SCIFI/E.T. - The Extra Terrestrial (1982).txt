I'm already one of the undead.
I can still throw death spells.

Don't be so cranky.

How about throwing a spell over the pizza man?

Where's our pizza, man?

Well, I'm ready now to play.

You got to cover me.

ELLIOTT: Well, come on.
Help me.

MIKE: We'll be waiting for you, Elliott.
So come back for sure.

It's too bumpy. We'll have to walk from here!

We're so late already.

(COUGHS)

We have to go home now, E.T.

(E.T. MOANS)

You should give them some time.

Ouch.

You could be happy here.

I could take care of you.

ELLIOTT: I wouldn't let
anybody hurt you.

We could grow up
together, E.T.

Home.

(COUGHS)

(WHISPERS) E. T?

E. T?

COP: How was he dressed
when last seen?

He was dressed as a

hunchback.

COP: Hunchback.

Is there anything to indicate
that he might have run away?

Any family problems or recent arguments?

My husband and I just separated recently

and it hasn't been easy on the children, but...

GERTIE: My father's in Mexico.

But run away, I...

Where would he
have gone? (SOBS)

MIKE: Elliott.

MARY: (SOBBING) Oh, Elliott!

(YELLING)
Don't ever do this again, Elliott!

Oh, my. You're so hot.

Run up and draw him
a bath. Quick, Gert.

(WHISPERING)
MARY: Sorry I yelled at you.

(TEARFULLY) Thanks very much
for all your trouble.

Is he here?

(SOBBING) You've got to find him, Mike.
MIKE: Where is he?

In the forest.

At the bald spot.

You've got to find him.

Michael, what are you talking about?

Just swear the most excellent
promise you can make.

Michael.

That's terrific.

We're sick.

I think we're dying.

MIKE: Mom, it's okay.

He's not going to hurt you, Mom.

He's not gonna hurt you.

It's the man from the moon.

(KEYS JANGLING)

MAN ON INTERCOM: The collagen unit,
report to the blue level immediately.

(KEYS JANGLING)

DOCTOR 1: Does he
sleep at night?

MARY: I don't know.
I don't know.

What's the matter with Elliott?

DOCTOR 2: Have you noticed any
surface sweating? MARY: No.

Has it lost any hair?
GERTIE: He never had any hair.

DOCTOR 1: Are the children all right?
MARY: Yes.

PSYCHIATRIST: Did it ever build
anything or write anything down?

MIKE: Uh... No.

Would you say it has the ability
to manipulate its own environment?

He's smart.
He communicates through Elliott.

Elliott thinks its thoughts.

No. Elliott feels
his feelings.

SCIENTIST 1: We've identified his primary
carrier protein by electrophoresis.

It's definitely not albumin.

SCIENTIST 2: Testing shows no
deficit. Some F&F. HTS test...

SCIENTIST 3: EEG analysis
shows complete coherence

and synchronization of brainwave
activity between both subjects.

DOCTOR 1: Skin biopsy reveals
9 millimeters of...

WOMAN ON INTERCOM:
Read isotonic.

Nitrates.
255 million equivalent.

DOCTOR 2: Better do IV
and oral contrast.

If there's no response, let's
move to hypertonic saline.

DOCTOR 3: We have
meta-starch available.

DOCTOR 2: Cut five per kilo.

DOCTOR 3: CVP line could help.

DOCTOR 2: I think you get more
information with this one gain.

ELLIOTT: You have no right to
do this. You're scaring him.

You're scaring him!

DOCTOR 2:
Respiratory rate, 12.

DOCTOR 4: Good air entry but
decreased tidal volume on the boy.

Put him on O2 five liters by nasal cannula
and draw blood gas in 20 minutes.

DOCTOR 2: Temperature's dropped
from 20 to 17 degrees centigrade.

DOCTOR 3: Get a
hypothermia blanket...

ELLIOTT: Please
leave him alone.

Can you leave him alone?
I can take care of him.

DOCTOR 2: Get a Doppler-scope in here
and set me up for a 2D cardiac echo.

DOCTOR 1: Skin is cool
and diaphoretic.

DOCTOR 2: He's not refusing at all.
He needs inotropic support.

DOCTOR 4: PH is down to 7.03.
He's got metabolic acidosis.

It could be sepsis.

DOCTOR 3: We've drawn two sets
of blood cultures.

DOCTOR 2: He needs broad-spectrum coverage.
How about amp, gen, flagyl?

(TAPPING ON GLASS)

KEYS: Elliott.

I've been to the forest.

MILITARY DOCTOR:
He shouldn't talk now.

Well, he has to talk now, Major.

Elliott, that machine, what does it do?

(VERY WEAKLY)
The communicator?

Is it still working?

KEYS: It's doing something.

What?

I really shouldn't tell.

(BREATHLESSLY)
He came to me.

He came to me.

Elliott, he came to me, too.

I've been wishing for this
since I was 10 years old.

I don't want him to die.

What can we do that we're not already doing?

He needs to go home.

He's calling his people

and I don't know where they are.

He needs to go home.

Elliott, I don't think that he
was left here intentionally.

But his being here is a miracle, Elliott.

It's a miracle.

And you did the best that anybody could do.

I'm glad he met you first.

DOCTOR 1: He's got DNA.
Incredible.

DOCTOR 1: He's got DNA.
ALL: What?

DOCTOR 1: He doesn't have four
nucleotides like we do. He has six.

DOCTOR 2: I've got de-synchronization
of the two brainwave activities.

DOCTOR 3: What are they?

E.T.!

NURSE 1: The boy's condition is stabilizing.
His blood pressure's coming back up.

E.T.

E.T. (HOARSELY): Elliott.

DOCTOR 4: He's speaking.
NURSE 2: He's talking.

E.T., stay with me.

Please.

E. T: Stay.

ELLIOTT: Together.

(GASPING FOR BREATH)
I'll be right here.

I'll be right here.

E. T: Stay.

Elliott.

Stay.

The creature's pressure is bottoming out.
His complexes are slow and widening.

DOCTOR 4: How's the boy?

He's converting back to normal sinus rhythm.

DOCTOR 2: They're separating.
DOCTOR 4: Yes, definitely separating.

DOCTOR 3: Boy and creature
are separating.

KEYS: What does that mean?
NURSE 1: The boy's coming back. We're losing E.T.

E.T., answer me, please.

DOCTOR 4: Everything is
going to be fine. Please.

DOCTOR 4: Just relax.

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

No!

E.T., don't go!
(ALARM RINGING)

No blood pressure.
He's got no pulse or respiration.

DOCTOR 1: We can't get a pulse or
blood pressure on the creature.

NURSE: It doesn't look like
he's breathing.

(E.T. GROANS)

ELLIOTT: Leave him alone!
You're killing him!

Leave him alone!

DOCTOR 2: Let's move it!

DOCTOR 1: Get the boy
out of here. Get him away.

(ELLIOTT SHOUTING)
Stop it! You're killing him!
You're killing him!

You're killing him!
You're killing him!

You're killing him!
He came to me!

DOCTOR 1: Any pulses?
Any pulses?

DOCTOR 2: Okay, let's go.
He came to me!

(ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

NURSE: Minimal breath sounds.

Calm down. Calm down. Calm...

Let's try some bretylium.
Can we have some bretylium, please?

Getting a pulse?

DOCTOR 3: Compressed air.
Compressed air's fine.

DOCTOR 2: Thank you.

All IV push.

He's not ventilating.

His pupils are fixed and dilated.

How about some more drugs?

Quiet.

Defibrillate him.

DOCTOR 4: Everybody, stand clear.
DOCTOR 1: Clear.

DOCTOR 2:
We're losing him.

DOCTOR 1: One more time.

Quiet.

DOCTOR 4: It's still v-fib.
DOCTOR 1: Okay, let's go.

Okay. Let's go. Let's go.

DOCTOR 3: Quiet.

MARY: Elliott?

Mom.

DOCTOR 3: Try calcium.

DOCTOR 1: He needs some
calcium in his body.

DOCTOR 2: Let's continue
CPR, please.

(POLICE RADIO CHATTER)

COP: Would you people
stand back?

Something's happening.

Ooh, they're going to die.
Shut up, Greg.

Something is definitely happening.

DOCTOR 2: Anybody have any ideas?
DOCTOR 1: EKG's flat.

DOCTOR 1: EKG's flat.
MILITARY DOCTOR: Okay, I'm going to call it.

DOCTOR 1: I think he's dead.
DOCTOR 2: No. I don't know.

MILITARY DOCTOR: All right.
I'm calling it.
What time do you have?

NURSE: 1536.

MILITARY DOCTOR:
15 hours, 36 minutes.

Okay.

Let's pack him in ice.

Let's leave.

Is he dead, Mama?

I think so, sweetheart.

Can we wish for him to come back?

Yeah.

I wish.

I wish, too.

MARY: Come on, Gert.
We'll wait for Elliott in the front room.

DOCTOR: Cardiac arrest was terminated
at 1500 hours and 36 minutes.

He received intravenous lidocaine,
intravenous epinephrine, a lidocaine drip,

2.7% sodium-chloride solution,
catheters from the "A" line.

And the intravenous line
should be sent for culture.

He was monitored with an EEG and an EKG.

He was defibrillated...

KEYS: They're going to have
to take him away now.

They're just gonna cut him all up.

Would you like to spend
some time alone with him?

(DOCTOR CONTINUING
HIS REPORT)

DOCTOR: Could we all
step out for a minute, please?

Look at what they've done to you.

I'm so sorry.

You must be dead

because I don't know how to feel.

I can't feel anything anymore.

You've gone someplace else now.

I'll believe in you all my life.

Every day.

E.T.,

I love you.

Oh, my God.

MARY: Who's gone, honey?
GERTIE: The boys.

What boys?

I'm supposed to give you

Give it to me now, Gertie.

Oh, my God.

Give me a hand with this.

(EXCLAIMS IN SURPRISE)

Where's your mask?
It's back here.

Well, get it on!
I'm trying!

Hey, who are you?

I'm driving.

Open the door, son.

There's a guy out here.
What do I do?

What are you waiting
for? Let's go!

ELLIOTT: Well, let's get

I've never driven forward before!

Get the bikes.
Meet us at the playground at the top of the hill.

Go, go, go!

We're all gonna die, and they're
never gonna give me my license.

(BOTH EXCLAIMING IN SURPRISE)

MIKE: Where's the playground?
It's near the preschool!

Where's that?
I don't know streets.
Mom always drives me.

Son of a bitch.

Well, can't he just beam up?

This is reality, Greg.
