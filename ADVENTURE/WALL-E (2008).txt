Out there
There's a world outside of Yonkers

Way out there
Beyond this hick town, Barnaby

There's a slick town, Barnaby

Out there
Full of shine and full of sparkle

Close your eyes
And see it glisten, Barnaby

Listen, Barnaby

Put on your Sunday clothes
There's lots of world out there

Get out the brilliantine
And dime cigars

We're gonna find adventure
In the evening air

Girls in white in a perfumed night

Where the lights are
Bright as the stars

Put on your Sunday clothes
We're gonna ride through town

In one of those new
Horsedrawn open cars

We'll see the shows at Delmonico's

And we'll close the town in a whirl

And we won't come home
Until we've kissed a girl

Ride through town

In one of those new
Horsedrawn open cars

We'll see the shows
At Delmonico's...

And we won't come home
Until we've kissed a girl

Oh!

Huh.

Buy N Large is your superstore

We got all you need
And so much more

Too much garbage in your face?

There's plenty of space out in space!

BNL star liners leaving each day.

We'll clean up the mess
while you're away!

The jewel of the BNL fleet, the Axiom.

Spend your five-year cruise in style,

waited on 24 hours a day
by our fully automated crew,

while your captain and autopilot

chart a course for nonstop
entertainment, fine dining,

and with our all-access hoverchairs,
even Grandma can join the fun.

There's no need to walk.

The Axiom.
Putting the star in executive star liner.

Because at BNL,
space is the final fun-tier!

No Monday in your Sunday

No Monday in your
Sunday clothes

Put on your Sunday clothes
when you feel down and out

Strut down the street
and have your picture took

Dressed like a dream
Your spirits seem to turn about

- That Sunday shine is a certain sign
- Oh-ho!

That you feel as fine as you look

And we'll recall

Wow.

When time runs out

Ah.

Whoa.

That it only

Took a moment

To be loved

A whole life

Long

And that is all

That love's about

Uh-oh.

Ooh!

Who are you?

Who are you? Who are you?

Hold me close and hold me fast

The magic spell you cast

This is la vie en rose

When you kiss me heaven sighs

And though I close my eyes

I see la vie en rose

Whoa!

When you press me to your heart

I'm in a world apart

A world where roses bloom

And when you speak
Angels sing from above

Everyday words seem
to turn into love songs

Hmm.

Uh-oh.

Put on your Sunday clothes

Strut down the street
and have your picture took

Dressed like a dream
Your spirits seem to turn about

That Sunday shine is a certain sign

That you feel as fine as you look

--New down to your toes

Get out your feathers
Your patent leathers

Your beads and buckles and bows

I've been in my cabin all morning,

so let's hover over to the driving range
and hit a few virtual balls into space.

No, we did that yesterday.
I don't want to do that.

- Well, then what do you want to do?
- I don't know. Something.

Whoa!

Look, I'm tired of having
the same argument over and over.

Bot, over here.

Whoa!

- I'm in a tunnel. I can't hear you.
- There you are.

Your day is very important to us.

Hey, drink-bot.

Please remain stationary.

A service-bot will be here
to assist you momentarily.

Stewards! Hello!

- Please remain stationary.

What's that? What's going on?

WALL-E.

Uh...

Uh, no. John.

EVE!

Bye, WALL-E.

"A" is for Axiom,
your home sweet home.

"B" is for Buy N Large,
your very best friend.

Mm!

Time for lunch in a cup.

Feel beautiful.

- It's the new you. Stunning.
- You look great.

- I know, honey. Men.
- Men.

Attention, Axiom shoppers. Try blue.

It's the new red.

Ooh!

Love blue.

Date?

Don't get me started on the date.

Every holo-date I have been on
has been a virtual disaster.

If I could just meet one,
one who wasn't so superficial, you know?

There are no good men out there.

I know. I know because I've...

- What the--?
- Whoa!

Huh?

Yoo-hoo. WALL-E.

Uh...

- EVE.

Huh? Oh!

Oh! Oh. Um, sure. You go ahead.

I didn't know we had a pool!

Captain, you are needed on the bridge.

All hands on deck!

Morning.

Just a trim?

Uh-huh.

I see. I know, honey. I know.

I'm good, I am good.
You look gorgeous.

-12:30!

Auto, why didn't you wake me
for morning announcements?

Honestly, it's the one thing
I get to do on this ship.

Well, good morning, everybody,

and, uh, welcome to day 255,642
aboard the Axiom.

As always, the weather is a balmy
72 degrees and sunny and...

Oh, I see the ship's log is showing
that today is our 700th anniversary

of our five-year cruise.

Well, I'm sure our forefathers would be
proud to know that 700 years later

we'd be doing the exact same thing
they were doing.

Fore!

So be sure next mealtime
to ask for your free

"septuacentennial cupcake in a cup.”

Wow, look at that!

Also today we have a...

Hey, Auto, what's that flashing button?

Captain,
Probe One has returned positive.

Positive?

EVE.

But no probe's

ever come back positive before.

Buy N Large

Greetings and congratulations,
captain.

If you are seeing this,

that means your
Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator,

or "EVE probe,”
has returned from Earth

with a confirmed specimen
of ongoing photosynthesis.

That's right. It means it's time
to go back home.

Home? We're going back?

Now that Earth has been restored
to a life-sustaining status,

by golly,
we can begin Operation Recolonize.

Simply follow
this manual's instructions

to place the plant
in your ship's holo-detector

and the Axiom will immediately
navigate your return to Earth.

- It's that easy.
- Huh.

Now, due to the effects of microgravity,

you and your passengers
may have suffered some

slight bone loss.

But I'm sure a few laps
around the ship's jogging track

will get you back in shape in no time.

We have a jogging track?

If you have any further questions,

just consult your operation manual.

See you back home real soon.

"Operate Manuel."

Uh...

Manuel, relay instructions.

Manuel?

Wow. Will you look at that?

Let's see.

Huh?

EVE.

WALL-E!

EVE.

Well, let's open her up.

"Step one.
Voice command, 'Confirm acquisition.'"

- Confirm acquisition.
- Ooh!

Voice authorization required.

- Uh...
- Uh...

Accepted.

Ooh.

- Where's the thingy?
- Plant.

Plant. Right. Right. Where is it?

Maybe we missed a step.

- Show me how you change...
- Plant.

- Okay.
- WALL-E.

WALL-E!

- EVE?
- Plant!

Why don't you
scan her to be sure?

Contains no specimen.
Probe's memory is faulty.

- So then, we're not going to Earth?
- Negative.

I guess things go back to normal, huh?

Correct, Captain.

- Well, false alarm!
- False alarm.

The probe must be defective.

GO-4, send her to the repair ward,

and have them run diagnostics on her.
Make sure she's not...

Aah!

WALL-E.

Have, uh, WALL-E cleaned.

Yoo-hoo! EVE.

Analyze.

Analysis.
Foreign contaminant.

Substance is a three-phase system

composed of various combinations
of naturally derived solids.

Subject is most commonly referred to
as soil, dirt, or earth.

"Earth"?

Hmm.

Define "earth."

Earth, the surface of the world

as distinct from the sky or sea.

Wow.

Define "sea."

Sea, an expanse of salt water

that covers most of the Earth's surface
and surrounds its landmasses.

Hey. I know that guy. It's, uh, WALL-E.

- Hey, WALL-E! It's your buddy John.
- Hi, WALL-E!

Hi.

Hi.

Define "hoedown."

Hoedown, a social gathering

at which lively dancing
would take place.

Auto, Earth is amazing!
These are called "farms."

Humans would put seeds
in the ground, pour water on them,

and they grow food, like pizza.

Good night, Captain.

Psst! Computer.

Define "dancing."

Dancing, a series of
movements involving two partners

where speed and rhythm
match harmoniously with music.

Uh-huh. Uh...

EVE.

Home.

Uh-oh.

The lido deck is now closing.
The lido deck is now closing.

- Stop that.

No splashing. No diving.

Shh!

Prepare for landing.

"We're here, everybody."

"Yay, Captain! Captain, we're home!
It's so beautiful!"

"No. It's nothing.
I was pleased to do this.

It's all about you people.
It's not about me."

How?

How did you find it?

We can go back home!
For the first time!

- What's it like now?
- Oh!

No, no, no. Don't tell me.
I want to see for myself.

Wait. That doesn't look like Earth.

Where's the blue sky?

Where's the grass?

Sunday clothes
when you feel down and out

I know that song.

Strut down the street
and have your picture took

They're, um,

dancing. Yes, dancing.

That Sunday shine is a certain sign
That you feel as fine as you look

Beneath your parasol...

You made it somehow, huh, little guy?
You didn't give up, did you?

Okay, then. Come on.

Wait a minute.

There you go, little guy.

You came a long way
for a drink of water.

Just needed someone
to look after you, that's all--

We have to go back.

- Auto, come down here.
- Aye, aye, Sir.

WALL-E.

WALL-E.

Auto, EVE found the plant.
Fire up the holo-detector.

Not necessary, captain.
You may give it to me.

- You know what? I should do it myself.
- Captain.

Sir, I insist you give me the plant.

- Auto, get out of my way.
- We cannot go home.

- What are you talking about? Why not?
- That is classified, captain.

- Give me the plant.
- What do you mean, "classified"?

- Don't keep a secret from the captain.
- Give me the plant.

- Tell me what's classified.
- The plant.

Tell me, Auto! That's an order.

Aye, aye, Sir.

Buy N Large is your superstore
We got all you need

Just cut it off, will you?

Hey, there, autopilots.
Got some bad news.

Um...

Operation Cleanup has,

well, failed.

Wouldn't you know,
rising toxicity levels have made life

unsustainable on Earth.

"Unsustainable"? What?

Darn it all, we're going to have
to cancel Operation Recolonize.

So just stay the course.

Um...

Rather than try and fix this problem,

it'll just be easier
for everyone to remain in space.

"Easier"?

- Mr. President?
- I think...

- Huh?
- Sir, time to go.

Okay. I'm giving
Override Directive A113.

Go to full autopilot.

Take control of everything,
and do not return to Earth.

Repeat, do not return to Earth.

Let's get the heck out of here.

Now, the plant.

No. Wait a minute.

Computer, when was that message
sent out to the Axiom?

Message received
in the year 2110.

That's... That's nearly 700 years ago!

Auto, things have changed!
We've got to go back.

Sir, orders are "do not return to Earth."

But life is sustainable now.
Look at this plant. Green and growing.

- It's living proof he was wrong.
- Irrelevant, captain.

What? It's completely relevant!
Out there is our home.

Home, Auto.

And it's in trouble.
I can't just sit here and do nothing.

That's all I've ever done.

That's all anyone on this blasted ship
has ever done. Nothing!

On the Axiom you will survive.

- I don't want to survive. I want to live!
- Must follow my directive.

I'm the captain of the Axiom.

We are going home today.

GO-4?

Hey! That's not...

This is mutiny! EVE, arrest him.

EVE, you are to put this plant
straight in the holo-detector.

No!

Huh?

- EVE?
- WALL-E!

EVE!

- Oh!
- WALL-E, the plant!

- WALL-E!
- Over here. Throw it.

Give me the plant.

This is the captain.
I am locked in my room.

EVE, WALL-E,
bring the plant to the lido deck.

I'll have activated the holo-detector.
Now, hurry.

- Auto's probably going to cut me off--
- Halt.

Ah!

Halt.

Oh, my.

Clear.

Oh!

Halt, halt.

- Look what I got, Auto.
- Not possible.

That's right. The plant.

You want it? Come and get it, blinky.

No.

Captain? Captain?

Let go.

- Let go.
- Too heavy for you? Huh?

Get off.

You're not getting away from me.

- Get off.
- Is that all you got?

Halt.

- That's it. A little closer.
- Cease and desist.

- Not good.
- Got you.

Whoa!

Remain calm. Remain calm.

Ladies and gentlemen,
this Is your captain speaking.

We're having a slight malfunction
with the autopilot.

Please remain calm.

Aah!

Enough.

Hey. What? John?

Whoa!

No! No, no, no!

I gotcha!

John, get ready to have some kids!

Go, go, go.

And we'll recall
When time runs out

This is called farming!

You kids are going to grow
all kinds of plants.

Vegetable plants. Pizza plants!

It's good to be home!

Took a moment

To be loved

A whole life

Long

Did you think that your feet
Had been bound

By what gravity brings
To the ground?

Did you feel you were tricked
By the future you picked?

Well, come on down

All these rules don't apply
When you're high in the sky

So come on down

Come on down

We're coming down to the ground

There's no better place to go

We got snow up on the mountains

We got rivers down below

We're coming down to the ground

We hear the birds sing in the trees

And the land will be looked after

We'll send the seeds
Out in the breeze

Did you think
You'd escaped from routine

By changing the script
And the scene?

Despite all you made of it

You're always afraid
Of the change

You've got a lot on your chest

Well, you can come as my guest

So come on down

Come on down

We're coming down to the ground

There's no better place to go

We got snow up on the mountains

We got rivers down below

We're coming down to the ground

We hear the birds sing in the trees

And the land will be looked after

We'll send the seeds
Out in the breeze

Like the fish in the ocean

We felt at home in the sea

We learned to live off the good land

We learned to climb up a tree

Then we got up on two legs

But we wanted to fly

And when we messed up
Our homeland

We set sail for the sky

We're coming down to the ground

There's no better place to go

We got snow up on the mountains

We got rivers down below

We're coming down to the ground

We hear the birds sing in the trees

And the land will be looked after

We'll send the seeds
Out in the breeze

We're coming down

Coming down to Earth

Like babies at birth

Coming down to Earth

We define new priorities

These are extraordinary qualities

We're coming down to the ground

There's no better place to go

We got snow up on the mountains

We got rivers down below

We're coming down to the ground

We hear the birds sing in the trees

And the land will be looked after

We send the seeds
Out in the breeze

We're coming down to the ground

There's no better place to go

We got snow up on the mountains

We got rivers down below

We're coming down to the ground

We hear the birds sing in the trees

And the land will be looked after

We send the seeds
Out in the breeze

We define new priorities

These are extraordinary qualities

To find on Earth

To find on Earth

To find on Earth
