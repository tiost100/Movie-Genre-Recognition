[MAN]
Brothers and sisters,

Today is the 15th of May...

The first day
of the planetary alignment...

And we are still no nearer to
discovering the location of the key.

It seems we are running
out of time.

This is not acceptable.

Mr. Powell, your
explanation for this is?

I have no explanation.
Certainly no excuses.

Except to once again
respectfully remind the council...

That we are working from clues
based on ancient cosmological models,

Predating Aristotle.

But I'm happy to announce
that we're almost ready.

And I am supremely confident...

That we will have our answer in time
for the relevant planetary alignment.

So, we will have possession
of the key in...

One week.

Yes, indeed. One week.

This is good news,
Mr. Powell, but remember:

We have only
a single opportunity...

To retrieve the two halves
of the triangle.

And if we fail,

We must wait
another 5,000 years.

I don't know about you,
but that's more time...

Than I am prepared to commit
to this enterprise.

- [CHUCKLES]
- We shall be ready.

Trust me.

We're not,
we're not ready, are we?

No.

[BIRDS CHIRPING]

Good morning, Lara. And
what a beautiful morning it is.

Back to work, I'm afraid.

It's adventure time.

It's nothing but
pyramids and sand.

I know, gets everywhere,

Spanish galleon?

Do you know what day
it is, Hillary?

Yes, of course.

The 15th.

And that is never a good day.

I miss you, daddy.

I wish we could get back the
time that was stolen from us.

[LARA] My father would
love to have seen this.

Tonight Pluto and Neptune
align with Uranus.

It's the first stage of the
alignment of all nine planets,

culminating in
a full solar eclipse.

It only happens
once every 5,000 years.

When is the eclipse?

In one week from today.

But there is plenty
to look out for until then.

Incredible.

[WIND BLOWING]

[MAN] I wish you
could remember her.

- She loved you so much.
- Mummy!

I wish I could remember her too.

I still have you, daddy.

Yes, you do.

The exact alignment of the planets
necessary to activate the triangle...

Only occurs once
every 5,000 years.

But that will prove to be
just long enough...

For little Lara Croft
to grow up...

- Hi.

You still pretending
to be a photo journalist?

You know, I think it's really
cool that you still have a day job,

Even though it's obviously
just for show.

So, Alex, are you still
pretending to be an archaeologist?

Lara,

do we always have to
fight like this?

I mean, maybe we don't.

- Maybe we do.
- Why?

- You stole my prayer wheels.
- Stole? Stole?

From you? You know,
that's funny. You know, it's...

It's not like you ever
really owned them or anything.

Hey, you're the tomb raider.

[MAN] Mr. West,
we are ready for you.

Oh, I think

Go ahead. You're

After all, as you once said so

Right?
So, go do business.

Go.

Lara. Lara, you...

[STAMMERS]
oh, geez!

Ladies and gentlemen...

Lara, this is a unique object.

Only one of the dials
is working.

It glows like the eye, lesser.

But it seems
to be getting brighter.

And it's also
running backwards...

Like it's not so much keeping time,
but counting down to something.

- Yes.
- And look at the back.

It's as though it fits into
something, almost like a key.

Yes. Yes, fascinating.

Incredibly beautiful.

My father once told me of a magical
triangle stamped with the all seeing eye.

He said it gave its possessor
extraordinary power...

The power to control time.

He called it the triangle of light.
Have you heard of it?

No. No, I haven't.

He always steered his
own course, your father.

He was a great man.

Would you like some port?

- It's really very fine.
- No.

I can't help you, Lara.

This clock truly is a mystery.

[PHONE RINGING]

- [LARA] Hello.

Hello, it's Mr. Wilson.

Yes. Well, I... you see,
I had a second thought...

About that clock.

There is a man who
may be able to help you.

I gave him your number. His name is
Manfred Powell. You should see him.

Oh, thank you.
I will.

- Good-bye, Lara.

He's a lawyer.

- A lawyer.
- Isn't it obvious?

Lady Croft, my pleasure.
Manfred powell, Q.C.

- Good morning.
- I believe you are quite an authority...

- On things ancient and mythological.
- Well, I travel.

No, no, Mr. Wilson said you
were quite the archaeologist.

Please.

Oh, he's very sweet.

He knew your father, I believe.

Yes, they were great friends.

I had the honor of meeting
him myself once, in Venice.

I was so sorry
to hear about his death.

This is the clock I spoke of.

Very interesting.

It's a shame you
only brought photographs.

Nevertheless, it is fascinating.

You said it started ticking
the night of the alignment.

Yes.

You said you were a lawyer?

- Yes.
- And the study of clocks is a hobby?

This is an obsession.

Really my specialty.
My practice centers around antiquities.

But the origin of this clock...

Completely eludes me.

I think I've never seen anything quite
so beautiful that I know so little about.

This is a pleasurable torment.

My ignorance amuses me.

"My ignorance amuses me."

[SCOFFS]
"My ignorance amuses me"?

Yes, well, I've always found
your ignorance quite amusing.

Powell, however,

{\an8}The all seeing eye.

[LORD CROFT'S VOICE]
My darling daughter,

I knew you'd figure this out.

If you are reading this letter,
I am no longer with you,

And I miss you...

And love you always and forever.

It also means I have failed...

And must place an awful
burden on your shoulders.

Lara, by now I am sure you will
have discovered the clock I concealed.

The clock is the key, Lara.

It will unlock the hiding place
of two pieces of a sacred icon.

This is the magical triangle I told
you about when you were a little girl.

The triangle of light.
But it is no bedtime story.

The triangle was forged from
metal found in the crater of a meteor...

That had fallen to earth
at the exact moment...

Of the previous alignment
of the nine planets.

The people of the light built
a great city in this crater...

Where they worshipped the
triangle for its ability to control time.

It gave its possessor a power that
could be used for good or great evil.

The abuse of this power led
to the destruction of the city.

To be sure no man would
ever again wield this power,

They split the triangle
into two pieces...

And hid them at
opposite ends of the earth.

Lara, do you remember
the jasmine that only grows...

In one temple along the
ancient khmer trail in Cambodia?

Find that and you will have found the
entrance to the tomb of the dancing light,

Where the first half
of the triangle is hidden.

You must be there
at the exact moment...

of the second phase
of the planetary alignment.

You must hurry.
You have very little time.

And as the planets
move into alignment,

The world will be
in great danger,

for the secret society
known as the Illuminati...

Devious dangerous men, who
seek to fulfill an ancient prophecy...

by reuniting the two halves...

And attaining the triangle's
awesome and terrible powers.

This you must prevent
at all costs.

So, Lara, I am asking you
to complete my work...

To find and destroy
both halves of the triangle.

How are you going to get to Cambodia
and get the clock back in 15 hours?

I'll be calling in a favor.

What kind of favor?

Well, that is a secret.

If I told you,
I'd have to kill you.

[MAN ON RADIO] Lady Croft,
are you on target? Over.

Right on target. Thank
you, boys. Over and out.

- Hey, Lara.
- Tourist visa?

- No, I'm working.
- Lady Croft, tell me,

is there a good reason
why I kept you alive?

[ALEX CONTINUES COUNTING]
Yes. That is not the true eye.

This is the true eye.

It's not, actually.
It's a mirror image.

Miss Croft, I think you're trying to
cheat me out of my little ray of sunshine.

Why would I try and cheat you
out of anything now?

I need you to get the piece
so I can steal it from you later.

You're bluffing.

Julius, make a mental note: kill miss
Croft if she attempts any such thing.

Yes, sir, Mr. Powell.

We can do it my way, or we can all
come back in time for the next alignment,

and you are welcome
to try and kill me then.

In, say another 5,000 years.

in 66 hours and 53 minutes,

And we've still got no idea

Have you brought my triangle?

No, of course you haven't.
You've hidden it somewhere.

Well, you can keep

and I will keep your father's
clock, and we can be partners.

Who sits here?

We can be partners

Yes, but who sits here?

It's an incredible dream,

It could set right

I don't think you sit here,

I sit here,

on God's right hand, as it were.

In fact, I now sit...

exactly where your father sat.

You're lying.

No.

No, he mentored me in the order.

It was truly an honor.

I don't believe you.

My father was not with the

He had a great many secrets.

{\an8}Not from me.

Especially from you.

- I know what you want, Lara.
- Oh, I doubt it.

Another life with your father,

a second chance.

It'll be within my power
to give.

The triangle gives
its possessor...

The power of God...

To move back and forth
through time, undo the past.

Help me, and you will get
what I know you want...

To have your father
returned to you.

And how do I know once
I gave you that piece...

that you wouldn't then
just try to kill me?

Would it make it easier

- [GRUNTING]
- Has she got the piece?

[WHIMPERING, HOWLING]

We will now unite
these two parts...

The past and the present.

At last, we of the Illuminati...

Will control time and fulfill the
sacred promise to our ancestors.

- Soon, the entire world will bow...
- Enough of this twaddle.

Come on! Come on!

[GRUNTING]

Not quite what you hoped for,
Mr. Powell?

Oh, Lara,

I have a gut instinct
about this.

After all, you are
the daughter of a genius.

Let me test my theory.

[SCREAMS]

[SCREAMING]

You had to let him go.
No more bubbles.

You show me how to complete
the triangle, we can change his fate.

If you deliver me the power
of god, I will spare him.

It's only a little trip
back in time.

But I'm pretty sure you've figured
out the answer to the problem.

And then, of course, there's
the loss of your father.

I can change that.

You'd better be ready for this.

- Unhook your laser sight.
- Do it.

"To see a world
in a grain of sand."

Lara!

[YELLING]

Daddy?

Lara.

Is this real?

It is a crossing...

Of my past and your present.

Why did you not tell me
about the Illuminati?

- You were only a child.
- You could have written in your journals.

You never mentioned it...
not once.

I burst to tell you everything.

But in the fierceness
of my own battles,

I strove to tell you only that which
would inspire you and keep you safe.

I love you so much.

But I've missed you.

And I have missed you.

{\an8}I know why you came here...

Why you took the power of the
light... but this must not happen.

Why? Why can't we use
the power just this once?

- Why can't you stay?
- We can't change time.

But time was stolen from us...

And it's not fair.

No, it's not fair.

But you have stolen time itself,

And you must give it back.

You must destroy the triangle.

Suddenly I feel so alone.

You're never alone. I am with you
always, just as I've always been.

No!
[GRUNTS]

- [SOLDIER] Move out!
- [GROANING]

[MOANING]

Lara!

Wait!

Your father begged for his life
when we caught him betraying us.

He pleaded like a baby.

Surrender.

Never.

He seemed particularly concerned
that I shouldn't... Take this.

Lara, no! The place is
coming down! This is insane!

Get them out of here.

You just hurry.

[CHUCKLING]

There you go...
safe and sound.

No guns.

[GROANING]

[GROANING]

[GROANING]

[GROANING]

[LAUGHING]

[HUMMING]

Oh, my god!

Quiet.
